<p class='pindent'>The mythologies, in which the faiths, philosophies
and fancies of the world have taken form, have
such truth and use in them that they endure, under
corresponding changes, through the reformations of
creeds and modifications of ceremony which mark
the history of natural religion throughout all ages
and countries. The essential unity of the race, its
kindred constitution of mind and affections, its likeness
of instincts, passions and aspirations, naturally
account for the under-lying agreement in principles,
and central similarity of beliefs, which are traceable
clean through, from the earliest to the most modern,
and from the most polished and elaborate eastern to
the rudest northern opinions; and the nice transitions
of doctrine from the infancy to the maturity of
faith and philosophy, are marked by an answering
variance in their significant ceremonials. But, however
mingled and marred, the inevitable truth is imbedded
in all the forms of fable, and, under an invariable
law of mind, the inspirations of fancy correspond
in essentials to the oracles of revelation, just
because human nature is one, and its relations to all
truth are fixed and universal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Creeds and formulæ, like the geological crusts of
the earth, at once retain and record the revolutions,
disintegrations, intrusions and submersions from
which they result. In the long succession of epochs
whole continents have risen from the deep, and the
vestiges of the most ancient ocean are found upon
the modern mountain tops; promontories have been
slowly washed away by the ceaseless waves, and
new islands have shot up from the ever-heaving sea.
Through the more recent crusts the primitive formations
frequently crop out upon the surface of the present,
and the comparatively modern, in turn, is often
found fossilized beneath the most ancient; dislocated
fragments are encountered at every step, and icebergs,
from the severer latitudes, are found floating
far into the tropical seas. Nevertheless, through all
changes of system, revolution has been ever in the
same round of celestial influences and relations, and
the alterations of form and structure have been only
so many different mixtures of unchanging elements,
from the simple primitives to the rich composite
moulds, into which the waters, winds and sun-light
have, in the lapse of ages, modified them. The constancy
of essential principles, through all mutations
of systematic dogmas, is strikingly analagous. The
law of adaptation links the material globe and the
rational race which occupies it in intimate relations,
and the universal unity in the great scheme of being
establishes such correspondences of organisms and
processes with ideas and ends, that the symbolisms
of poetry and mythology are really well based in the
truth of nature, and the essential harmonies of all
things are with equal truth, under various forms,
embraced by fiction and fact, fable and faith, superstition
and enlightened reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The true light, which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world;” “the grace that hath
appeared unto all men;” and “the invisible things
of the Creator, clearly seen and understood by the
things which are made,” are propositions which
have the formal warrant of our sacred books to back
the authority of logical demonstration. Moreover,
it is pleasant and profitable to believe that “He hath
not left himself without a witness” among any of
the tribes of men. The human <span class='it'>brotherhood</span> is so involved
in the divine fatherhood, that the individual’s
hold on the infinite and eternal must stand or fall
with the universality of His regards and providence.
If Canaan had been without a “Prophet of the Most
High,” if Chaldea had been left without soothsayer
and seer, and classic Greece and Rome destitute of
oracles and Sibylline revelations, the Jewish theology
and the Christian apocalypse would stand unsupported
by “the analogy of faith,” and our highest
hopes would be shifted from the broad basis of an
impartial benevolence, to a narrow caprice of the
“Father of all Men.” But, happily, the sympathies
of nature, the deductions of reason, and the teachings
of the Book, are harmonious on this point, for we find
Melchisedec, who could claim no legal or lineal relation
to the Levitical priesthood, the chosen type of the
perpetual “High Priest of our profession;” and Balaam,
notwithstanding his heathen birth, and ministry
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
among the Canaanites when their cup of iniquity
was full; and the eastern Magi, who brought their
gifts from afar among the Gentiles, to the new-born
“King of the Jews,” all alike guided by the same
light, and partakers and fellow-laborers in the same
faith, with the regular hierarchy of Mount Zion.
So, the Star of Jacob is the “desire of nations,”
and the heart and hope of the wide world turneth
ever toward the same essential truth, and strive after
it by the same instinct through a thousand forms,
“if haply they may find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The religious system of the Jews and Chaldeans
agreed, with wonderful exactness, in the doctrine
of angelic beings and their interposition in the affairs
of men. The superintendence of the destinies of nations
and individuals, and the allotment of provinces,
kingdoms and families among these ministering spirits,
are as distinctly taught in the book of Daniel of
the old testament, and in the gospel of St. Matthew
of the new, as in the popular beliefs of the Arabians
and Persians; indeed, the Bible sanction is general,
particular, and ample, for the doctrine of angelic
ministry as it has been held in all ages and throughout
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The order and organization of these celestial beings,
among whom the infinite multiplicity of providential
offices is thus distributed, falling within the
domain of marvelousness and ideality, of course,
took the thousand hues and shapes which these prismatic
faculties would bestow; and in the various
accommodations and special applications of the doctrine,
it naturally grew complicated, obscure, and
sometimes even incoherent; but in all the confusion
of a hundred tongues, kindreds and climates, a substantial
conformity to a common standard is apparent
enough to prove the identity of origin and the fundamental
truth common to them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to introduce one of these remarkable correspondences
that these reflections are employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fairy tales, it is said by encyclopedists, were
brought from Arabia into France in the twelfth century,
but this can only mean that that was the epoch
of the exotic legends. In England, if they were not
indigenous, they certainly were naturalized centuries
before Chaucer flourished; and they were as familiar
as the catechism, and almost as orthodox, when
Spencer, <a id='with'></a>wrote his Fairy Queen, and Shakspeare employed
their agency in his most exquisite dramas.
But their date is, in fact, coeval with tradition, and
earlier than all written records, and their origin is
without any necessary locality, for they spring spontaneously
from faith in the supernatural. They are
inseparable from poetry. The priesthood of nature,
which enters for us the presence of the invisible and
converses familiarly with the omnipresent life of the
creation, recognizes the administration of an ethereal
hierarchy in all the phenomena of existence; they
serve to impersonate the spiritual forces, which are
felt in all heroic action, and they graduate the responsive
sympathies of Heaven to all the supernatural
necessities of humanity. The live soul can
make nothing dead; it can take no relation to insensate
matter; it invests the universe with a conscious
life, answering to its own; and an infinite multitude
of intermediate spirits stand to its conceptions for the
springs of the universal movement. Rank upon
rank, in spiral ascent, the varied ministry towers
from earth to heaven, answering to every need, supporting
every hope, and environing the whole life of
the individual and the race with an adjusted providence,
complete and adequate. In the great scale,
place and office are assigned for spirits celestial,
ethereal and terrestrial, in almost infinite gradation.
The highest religious sentiments, the noblest styles
of intellect and imagination, and the lower and
coarser apprehensions of the invisible orders of being,
are all met and indulged by the accommodating
facility of the system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The race of Peris of Persia, and Fairies of western
Europe, hold a very near and familiar relation to the
every day life of humanity, by their large intermixture
of human characteristics and the close resemblance
and alliance of their probationary existence
and ultimate destiny to the life and fortunes of men.
A commonplace connection with ordinary affairs
and household interests constitutes the largest part
of the popular notion of them; and their interferences
among the vulgar are almost absurd and ludicrous
enough to impeach the earnestness of the superstition;
but our best poets have shown them capable
of very noble and beneficent functions in heroic story.
Like our own various nature, they are a marvellous
mixture of the mighty and the mean, the magnanimous,
the malignant and the mirthful; they stand,
in a word, as our own correspondents in a subtler
sphere, and serve to illustrate, by exaggerating, all
that is true and possible in us, but more probable of
them—our own shadows lengthened, and our own
light brightened into a higher life. In some countries
the legends are obscure, in others clear; but
they all agree well enough in ascribing their origin
to the intermarriage of angels with “the daughters
of men,” and that they are put under penance and
probation for the recovery of their paradise. So,
like our own race, they have fallen from a higher
estate; their natures are half human, and their general
fortunes are freighted on the same tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nursery tale of the Sleeping Beauty will serve
capitally to illustrate our theme. Handed down from
age to age, and passed from nation to nation, through
the agency of oral tradition chiefly, it has of course
taken as many shapes as the popular fancy could impart
to it; but the essential points, seen through all
the existing forms, are substantially these:</p>

<p class='pindent'>A grand coronation festival of a young queen abruptly
opens the story. The state room of the palace
is furnished with Oriental magnificence. The representatives
of every order, interest and class in the
kingdom—constructively the whole community—are
present to witness and grace the scene. The fairies
who preside over the various departments of nature,
and the functions and interests of society, are assembled
by special invitation to invoke the blessings and
pledge the favors of their several jurisdictions to the
opening <a id='reign'></a>reign. The ceremony proceeds; the young
queen is crowned; the priest pronounces the benediction,
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
and the generous sprites bestow beauty and
goodness, and every means of life and luxury, until
nothing is left for imagination to conceive or heart
to wish. But an unexpected and unwelcome guest
arrives—an old Elf, of jealous and malignant character,
whose intrusion cannot be prevented, and whose
power, unhappily, is so great, that the whole tribe
of amicable spirits cannot unbind her spells. Neither
can she directly revoke their beneficences; for such
is the constitution of fairy-land that the good and
evil can neither annihilate each other’s powers nor
check each other’s actions, and their active antagonism
can have place and play only in issues and effects.
The good commanded and dispensed cannot
be utterly annulled, the profusion of blessings prepared
and pledged cannot be hindered in their source
or interrupted in their flow, but the recipients are the
<a id='deb'></a>debatable ground; they are, within certain limits,
subject to the control of the demon, and the <span class='it'>end</span> is
as well attained by striking them incapable of the
intended good. The queen and her household are
cast into a magic slumber until (for the Evil will be
ultimately destroyed by the Good) an age shall elapse
and bring a Deliverer, who, through virtue and courage,
shall dissolve the infernal charm. The blight
fell upon the paradise in its full bloom, and it remained
only for the youngest fairy present, who had
withheld her benefactions to the last, to mitigate the
doom she could not avert, by bestowing pleasant
dreams upon the long and heavy sleepers. A century
rolls round. The Knight of the Lion undertakes
the enterprise; encounters the horrible troops of
monsters and foul fiends which guard the palace;
overcomes them; enters the enchanted hall, and
wakens the whole company to life, liberty and joy
again. The knight is, of course, rewarded with the
love he so well deserves and the hand he has so
richly earned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is obviously the story of the apostacy and redemption
of the human family, in the form of a fairy
legend. It conforms closely to the necessary incidents
of such a catastrophe, and answers well and
truly to the intuitive prophecy of man’s final recovery.
In substance and method the correspondence is obvious.
Every notion of “the fall,” whether revealed
or fictitious, assumes the agency of “the wicked
one;” and the final recovery, universally expected,
involves the sympathies and employs the services of
the “ministering spirits,” as important instruments
in the happy consummation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tale was presented as a dramatic spectacle
last winter at the Boston Museum. The play is a
minutely faithful expositor of the legend; and it is
by the aid of this fine scenic exhibition that I am
able to adjust the details, of which the primitive
story is so legitimately capable, to the answering
points in the great epic of human history “as it is
most surely believed among us.” The parallel presented
does not seem to me fanciful, but the circumstantial
exactness of resemblance may, I think, be
accounted for without supposing a designed imitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before tracing the specialties and their allusions,
let us notice the general parallelism found between
the <a id='piv'></a>pivotal points of the fabulous and authentic representations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bible Eden is introduced at the same stage of
the story’s action and in the same attitude to the
principal characters of the narrative; it stands on
the coronation day of its monarch, perfect in all its
appointments; the realms of air, earth and ocean in
auspicious relation, every element harmoniously obedient,
and the garden still glows with the smile which
accompanied the approving declaration, “it is very
good.” Dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the face of the earth, is conferred, and
the heavens add their felicities to the inaugural rejoicings—“the
morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy.” The gifts are
without measure or stint, and the Divine beneficence
cannot be tainted in its source nor impeded in its efflux,
but the intended recipients, by “the wiles of
the enemy,” are rendered incapable of the enjoyment.
The sin-blunted sense and passion blinded
soul of the fallen race, are plunged into a spiritual
stupor, which sleep—the sister and semblance of
death—strikingly illustrates; and through the long
age of moral incapacity which follows, the highest
mode of life is but dimly recognized and feebly felt
in the dreams of a paradise lost and the visions of a
millenium to come; till, “in the fullness of time,”
when a complete <a id='psyc'></a>psychical age shall be past. The
Deliverer, having first overcome the wicked one,
shall lead captivity captive, and by the “marriage
of the Lamb” with “the bride which is the Church,”
perfect the redemption and bring in the new heavens
and new earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to the fable, the dramatic representation and
the interpretation thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene opens upon a rustic society, a hamlet,
in the infancy of civilization, such as, upon ballad
authority, was “merrie England” before the age
of her conquests in arts, sciences and arms, and before
the crimes and cares of her age of glory replaced
the days of her innocence and contentment. Simplicity
of manners, modest abundance, moderate labor,
aspirations limited to the range of things easy of attainment,
and opinions comfortably at rest on questions
of policy and religion, describe the rural life
upon Monsieur Bonvive’s domain. The master, in
bachelor ease, superintends the simple affairs of his
village; Madam Babillard, the house-keeper, has the
necessary excitement without the anxiety of her
post—just the amount of trouble that is interesting
with the pigs, poultry and pets of the homestead.
The girls, indeed, are too hasty in ripening into
womanhood, and the beaux are over-bold in their
gallantries; but then, these are things of great consequence
to her, and she is, through them, a matter
of great consequence to the community, and the
exercise of authority amply repays all its troubles and
responsibilities. The affairs of the commonwealth
take good enough care of themselves generally; the
people are happy in the enjoyment of what they
have, and equally happy in the unconsciousness of
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
what they have not; the holydays come at least
once a-week, and there is space and place for
work and play every hour of every day. Good consciences,
light hearts, and natural living, carry them
along very happily, and they have enough of the
little risks and changes of fortune to keep the life
within them well alive. The wilderness upon which
their village borders is known to be infested with
hobgoblins and demons, and there is a current belief
that in the centre of the forest there is a princely
family bound in a spell for a hundred years, but
they have never penetrated the mystery nor clearly
ascertained the facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among these simple people there is an ancient dame,
who was old when the oldest villager first knew her,
and she has lived through all the known generations
of men. Her whole life has been a continual exercise
of the best offices among the people; she has
been nurse and doctress, friend and counselor, by
turns, to the whole community, and they repay her
with the love and veneration which her goodness
and wisdom command. She is now apparently in
the decrepitude of extreme age, but the frame only
assumes the marks of age—the mind is as young and
the affections as fresh as they were “a hundred
years ago.” She is the “Fairy of the Oak,”—the
youngest at the coronation scene, and the tutelary
spirit of the enchanted family. Ever since the hour
of their evil fortunes she has inhabited a human
form, performing the charitable offices of ordinary life
and mitigating its incident evils; but, especially she
has been cultivating whatever of virtuous enterprise
and aspiration appeared among the youth from generation
to generation, directing it into the best service
and endeavoring by it the deliverance of the imprisoned
spirits under her charge. Patiently and
lovingly she has striven, earnestly and anxiously she
has watched, every promise of a deliverance that
the race from age to age produced. Patriarch, prophet,
apostle and philanthropist, has each in his degree
done his own good work, and the world has
been the better that they lived; each has added another
assurance of the ultimate success, but themselves
“have died without the sight.” Her own
powers, and those of her auxiliaries, are vast and
supernatural, indeed, but the champion age of human
redemption must be human, and she can
but inspire, direct, sustain and guard the mighty
effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, a young Christian Knight “the Knight of
the Lion,” famous for deeds of valor in Holy Land,
gives promise of the great achievement to the quick
perception of the Guardian Spirit. She has aroused
his enthusiasm and sustained his zeal, disciplining
him by trial after trial, and training him from triumph
to triumph, for still greater deeds, which take
continually more definite shape and more attractive
forms in the dreams and reveries which she inspires,
until he has grown familiar with the vision and conscious
of its supernatural suggestion, and she is able
at last to intimate the duty and the trial which invite
him by songs in the air addressed to his waking
ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drawn westward by her art toward the scene of
the great enterprise, he reaches the village on the
border of the wilderness, and from the legend current
among the rustics inferring more definitely the
character of his mission, he accepts it in the true
chivalric spirit of faith, love and hope. His squire,
or man-at-arms, who has followed him heretofore
with an unquestioning fidelity, consents to incur the
risks, though he has a very imperfect apprehension
of the heroic undertaking; but the devotion of a
faithful follower answers instead of knowledge in his
rank of service. He would rather encounter a dozen
flesh and blood swordsmen than one ghostly foe;
nevertheless, where his master leads he will follow,
whatever the character of the fight. The knight
comprehends the nature of the conflict fully; it is
not with flesh and blood, but with “spiritual wickedness
in high places” that he “has his warfare.”
To him the great battle is not in the outward and
actual, but is transferred to the inward and spiritual
sphere—into the real life—whence the ultimate facts
of existence derive all their currents and ends. So
felt the hero who said, in the great faith, “we have
our conversation in heaven”—“we sit in heavenly
places;” and so felt and thought the reformer who
deliberately threw his ink-stand at the devils’ head.
The region of the ideal is the fields of the highest
heroism, and every life given to the world in noble
service and generous sacrifice is living in the spirit
sphere in familiar sympathy with the good, and constant
strife with evil angels. This faith is the main
impulse in all chivalric action; even a heroic poem
cannot be created without it. It cannot be false, for
it differs nothing in the constancy and efficiency of
its presence from the most palpable facts, and is
proved true by the test of harmonizing with all other
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight personates the highest ideal of philanthropy;
the squire stands for the lower, more palpable
modes of practical benevolence and reform.
They are distinguished as widely as general and
special providence, as the thorough emancipation of
the soul and the charity which relieves the body, or
the whole difference between the apostleship of spiritual
and that of civil liberty. They correspond respectively
to the Prophet Elisha, who saw the mountain
tops filled with horses and chariots of fire, outnumbering
and overwhelming the hosts of the Syrian
king; and his servant, who saw but two men,
his master and himself, opposed to a numerous and
well appointed army. Such is the difference between
the seer and the servant in any labor or conflict
of faith—in any enterprise which involves the
spiritual forces that rule the movements of the
world. Throughout the whole action of the drama
the agency and deportment of the knight and his follower
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
are marked by this distinction. But the scene
shifts, and the sympathetic and corroborative movements
in Fairy-land, are revealed. The Fairy of the
Oak appears and summons the spirits of the Air,
Earth, Water and Fire. The elements, disordered
by the fall, and thenceforth at war with the poor fugitive
from Paradise, must render their aid in his
restoration, that when the last enemy is put under
his feet the material creation, cursed for his sin, may
be renewed with his recovery, and the harmonies of
matter answer to the sanctities of spirit. The spirits
of the material forces obey the invocation, and cordially
promise sympathy and service:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The actors, human and ethereal, thus adjusted to
their several offices, the knight and his squire enter
the haunted wood—the squire to struggle with the
grosser forms of evil, some as ludicrous as sad,
others as horrible as atrocious, and all odious, coarse
and palpable; the knight to be tempted of the devil,
and do battle with him for the redemption of the enchanted
family from his dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the open front of the stage, darkened with
smoke and foul with offensive odors of noxious
gases, the squire is hotly engaged with the great
dragon, in close rencontre, and at the same time assailed
above, around, in flank and rear, by harpies,
fiery serpents, and other forms of terror—the battle
of life translated into coarse <span class='it'>diablerie</span>. The sentiment
and significance of the play in this take great
liberties with the regular charities and practical reforms
of our social system. The sorts of evil which
these monsters so uncouthly represent are such as
physical suffering, drunkenness, violence, fraud, and
the thousand shapes of slavery, personal and political,
and of all castes and colors. They are represented
as greedy and ugly, and full of mocking and malignity,
but with little intrinsic capability of mischief,
for they are really unattractive in temptation and extremely
awkward in battle, and much more remarkable
for thick-skinned insensibility to assault than
for any adroitness in the combat. The squire bravely
deals his blows upon the great dragon. Horror, fear
and hatred of the monster, earnest devotion to the
“great cause,” with the courage of full commitment,
and, perhaps, some regard for his reputation
as a hard-hitter, put life and metal in his veins, and
right lustily he mauls away. The earliest effects of
his prowess are remarkable. The dragon, defending
his own ground as confidently and angrily as if the
empire of evil were really a rightful one wherever
sanctioned by antiquity of <a id='poss'></a>possession, dashes his
ponderous jaws at the reckless agitator, opened wide
enough to swallow him, with all his weapons and
armor at a gulp; but he manages to elude the <a id='clums'></a>clumsy
wrath, and, nothing daunted and nothing doubting,
deals his blows with energy in the ratio of the
rage they rouse. Curiously, but conformably enough,
at every stroke another ring of the monster’s tail unrolls.
At first he was an unwieldy, but not an
utterly misshapen brute; now he has become a serpent
and a scarecrow; the head and tail are as incongruous
as the pretended righteousness of his
cause and his villainous method of defending it. The
strife goes on, and grows only the worse and wickeder
for its continuance, till it is plain that the beast
is not to be mastered with hard blows, and if he
yields it is because his huge, unwieldy bulk is exhausted
with the protracted effort of defense, and he
subsides at last rather than submits. So ends the
battle, and then comes the triumph. The valorous
victor, claiming all the honors he has won, mounts
his sometime foe in the new character of hobby, and
rides him grandly off the stage in a blaze of gaseous
glory, cheered most vociferously by the boys and affording
not a little merriment, mixed with admiration,
to the old folks. What a figure that procession
made! and how exact a figure, too, of many another
that the world witnesses admiringly. The squire is,
however, none the less a hero that his principles are
rugged, his method rude, his ideas a little vulgar,
and his aims tinged but not tainted with his egotism.
The dragons, serpents and hobgoblins must be routed,
and he is the man for the emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the while this palpable warfare is proceeding
in open view, the knight is engaged with the
subtler fiends in the dim and doubtful darkness of the
background. Quite behind the scenes the severest
strife is maintained, but enough is seen and intimated
upon the stage to reveal the real character of the
conflict. The fidelity of illustration in the conduct
of the allegory here was really admirable. At one
time we descried him through the gloom by the
flashing of his sword, engaged in hand-to-hand combat
with a host of fiends, rushing upon the foe with
true chivalric enthusiasm; at another, hard pressed
and well-nigh exhausted, sternly enduring the blows
he could not parry or repay—exhibiting, in turn,
every mood of courage to do and fortitude to endure
the varied fortunes of the field. But anon, with
equal truthfulness of portraiture, he is discovered
trembling in sudden and strange panics, which show
the temporary failure of his faith, and seem to
threaten his utter desertion of the field. In the open
presence of the foe his courage never fails, but the
stratagem of darkness and desertion successfully
evades the sword-thrust and the shield’s defense, and
gives him up to doubt and desperation. The powers
of darkness take hold upon him, and in his agonies
of fear and suffering he would, if it were possible,
that the cup might pass from him. In these moments
of anguish and depression the Fairy of the
Oak instantly appeared to strengthen him. With a
touch and a word she reassures him, and the divine
virtue again shines out, exposing visibly the demon
of the doubt, and the good sword again flashes in the
gloom, and the fiends, forced into open fight, are
finally overthrown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bulwer strikes the same profound fact of experience
in heroic enterprise, in his “Terror of the
Threshold.” The reformer, however, confident in
virtue and assured of the goodness of his undertaking,
naturally trembles at critical stages of revolution in
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
opinions and institutions long established and interwoven
with the existing order of society, for the
risk of introducing new truths may well check the
current of a wise man’s zeal. If I pull down, he
will say, this temple whose ceremonial, though barbarous
and blinding, yet supports the morals of the
worshiper and the present order of the social system,
will the liberty and light bestowed avail for the
designed improvement, or will they only unsettle the
securities of law and prove occasions of disorder
and licentiousness? The brave bigot and fiery enthusiast
know nothing of this indecision. The cautious
hesitation which springs from solicitude for the
best ends and most expedient means, never troubles
their stubborn bluntness of purpose nor abates their
boasted consistency of action. But the regular procedure
of Providence is marked by regard for the influence
of conditions and the established law of progress.
In these things the highest benevolence meets
impediments and suffers modifications and even
submits to postponement to avoid defeat; and the
agents and instruments of the world’s regeneration
have their Gethsemanes as well as their triumphs
and transfigurations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing in language, scenery or costume irreverently
asserted the allusions which I am exposing.
I do not know that either playwright, performer or
spectator was concerned about or even conscious of
the significant symbolism of the fable and its circumstantial
exposition in the play. It was produced as a
beautiful dramatic spectacle. Apart from any mystical
meanings, it was a perfect luxury of scenic entertainment.
It was so regarded by the visiters, and
probably was designed for nothing more; but to me
the analogy was a surprise and a delight, growing at
every step of the development. It struck me first
when I saw the knight and his brave squire standing
on the threshold of the enchanted hall, after their
victory in the wilderness. With equal zeal, truthfulness
and devotion they had battled with the formidable
foe, but with very different aims and apprehensions.
The difference was most manifest when
they stood in the presence of the enchanted family.
The knight, breathless with awe and melting with
compassion, showed how tenderly and reverently
he felt the moral and mental bondage which struck
his opened vision; but the squire, though so faithful
and loyal as a follower, and efficient as a servant,
had yet not the penetration of a seer; and the preposterous
spectacle of princes, counselors, knights,
esquires, priests, soldiers, pages, artisans, musicians,
dancers, slaves, retainers—every class and calling
among men—all arrested in mid-action, and slumbering
for a century amid the luxury and pageantry of a
gorgeous festival, with the viands untasted and the
cup undrained before them, struck him with a comic
wonder and pleasant sportiveness which he cared
not to suppress. Approaching the venerable prime
minister of the realm, who sat with the goblet near
his lip, immovable as death, the thirsty soldier familiarly
proposed to drink his health, and only made
mouths at the cup when he found it “as dry as
dust.” The cheek of the dancing girl, who stood
pivoted for her century upon one toe, he found “as
cold as a stone;” and the apples offered by an African
slave to a guest, whose hand hung arrested midway
in the reach, proved to his disappointed taste a petrified
humbug. The whole scene of deprivation
and incapacity before him he pronounced an epidemic
sleeping fever, and he wondered if it was
catching, and where and how he should get his
dinner!</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this has its parallel and exposition in the boys
that mock a drunkard reeling through the street, and
the contrasted sadness which a soul alive to the
moral ruin feels at the same sight; or it may be witnessed
again in the conduct of an insensible boor
and that of a person of refinement in the presence of
the insane; and in general, in the sentiments of those
who have, and those who have not, learned that
“the life is more than meat, and the body than raiment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These reflections present themselves in the pause
while the champion stands, riveted with emotions of
wonder and pity at the mingled gloom and glory of
the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the action proceeds again. A strain of melody
spontaneously waking from the silence of an age,
fitly preludes and prophesies the harmonies of the
new era, and there wants only the taliha-cumi of the
Deliverer to awaken the princess and her household
into the activities of full life. At the bidding of the
minstrel he advances to her pavilion. Answering to
his word and touch, she rises. One by one the women
first resume their proper consciousness, and the
revival of the men follows in proper order, till the
spell is broken and the last shadow of the long night
gives place to the perfect day. The renovated
realm every where receives its primal beauty, the
flowers of Eden bloom again, and the fruits regain
their flavor, the wine is new in the new kingdom,
and all the material ministries of life without, respond
to the renewed faculties within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fable has not yet exhausted the facts. Obeying
the poetical necessities of the epic story, and
conforming also to the <a id='apo'></a>apocalyptic vision of the
world’s fortunes, which are to follow the first victory
over the dragon and the binding of the adversary
for a thousand years, we have the peace and
happiness of the disenchanted household once more
disturbed. The prince of the powers of darkness,
that great magician who is the author of all the mischief
from the beginning, is “loosed out of his prison,”
and gathering all his forces for a final battle,
he surrounds the castle. The queen’s army, led by
the knight, go out to meet the grand enemy in battle,
and he is utterly overthrown and his power broken
for ever. The conquerors return in triumph to the
castle, and in the midst of their rejoicings a herald
from the outer wall, who has witnessed the scene,
announces the total annihilation of the enemy. The
elements, marshaled by their ruling spirits, have
overwhelmed him; a tempest of hail and fire bursts
upon his castle, and the earth opening has swallowed
up the last vestige of his kingdom and power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle of Gog and Magog (20th Rev.) in which
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
the deceived of the four quarters of the earth are gathered
together, and compass the camp of the saints
about, is the very prototype of this incident in our
story, and “the fire which came down from heaven,”
and the “casting of the devil which deceived them
into the lake of fire and brimstone,” is only a different
expression of the same final deliverance of the human
family from the last enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marriage rites close and crown the grand
achievement, and a magnificent tableau illustrates
the consummation. The spirits of the elements
arise, and array themselves in a vertical arch upon
the stage. The centre and summit is occupied by a
new figure, now first introduced, costumed appropriately
in pure white, representing Truth in augurated
or universal harmony; the Spirit of Earth at
the base on one side, and of Water at the other,
while impersonations of Air and Fire occupy the intermediate
positions. This bow of beauty and promise,
emblematically dressed and decorated, stood a
happy symbol of the restored order of the material
creation. The household, artistically arranged and
displayed, represented the divine order of society,
where government and liberty, refinement and efficiency,
luxury and industry, are reconciled, and man
with his fellow man is organized in the harmonies of
the creative scheme. And, that the joy may be full
to the utmost limits of communion and sympathy, the
Fairy of the Oak is seen ascending, to take possession,
in behalf of her race, of their recovered heaven—the
guerdon of their services to the redeemed family
of Adam. So, the last scene in the drama
mingles the new Heavens with the new Earth, and
all the worlds in our universe triumph together in the
general resurrection, as they rejoiced on the birth-day
of the creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know the history of the fairy tale, its age
or origin. I know nothing of the design with which
it was prepared for theatrical representation, nor do
I see why it should be inferred, because the idea and
method are so strikingly significant, that the manager,
after the fashion of the ancient “Mysteries,”
intended to restore sacred subjects to the stage in
allegorical disguise. I suppose that the fable is
simply fancy’s method of the great fact, and that its
doctrinals are the natural intuitives and inevitable
theory of the human mind concerning the mystery of
life, the great epochal experiences of the human family,
their final fortunes, and the interests and sympathies
of other worlds included; for such conceptions
as these are general and common among all
men. The question of special revelation is not affected
by its concurrence with universally received
ideas. The correspondence pervading all systems
proves the truth and unity of origin of the essential
points in all, but in no wise touches the method of
their revealment, discovery or propagation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The points and particulars of the play are none of
them manufactured to supply the running parallel
we have given, nor are they nearly exhausted.
Moreover, it will readily occur that the plan of the
play illustrates the whole philosophy of world-mending
by its merely human hero. The actual and
eventual progress of civilization, religion and liberty
can be laid down upon its scheme in the exactest
detail of principles, which facts <span class='it'>must</span> follow and
fulfill. The supernatural agencies introduced also
answer this aspect and rendering of the myth. They
well represent the material and immaterial forces
concerned in all societary movements, and if they
may not serve for the religion of the great process,
they may do duty as philosophical abstractions, or
as a beautiful system of poetical symbolism—for in
the mystical correspondence of all these systems of
ideas there is such fundamental unity of use.</p>

<p class='line'>Storm-wearied Argo slept upon the water.</p>
<p class='line'>No cloud was seen; on blue and craggy Ida</p>
<p class='line'>The hot noon lay, and on the plain’s enamel;</p>
<p class='line'>Cool, in his bed, alone, the swift Scamander.</p>
<p class='line'>“Why should I haste?” said young and rosy Hylas:</p>
<p class='line'>“The seas were rough, and long the way from Colchis.</p>
<p class='line'>Beneath the snow-white awning slumbers Jason,</p>
<p class='line'>Pillowed upon his tame Thessalian panther;</p>
<p class='line'>The shields are piled, the listless oars suspended</p>
<p class='line'>On the black thwarts, and all the hairy bondsmen</p>
<p class='line'>Doze on the benches. They may wait for water,</p>
<p class='line'>Till I have bathed in mountain-born Scamander.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>So said, unfilleting his purple chlamys</p>
<p class='line'>And putting down his urn, he stood a moment,</p>
<p class='line'>Breathing the faint, warm odor of the blossoms</p>
<p class='line'>That spangled thick the green Dardanian meadows.</p>
<p class='line'>Then, stooping lightly, loosened he his buskins</p>
<p class='line'>And felt with shrinking feet the crispy verdure,</p>
<p class='line'>Naked, save one light robe, that from his shoulder</p>
<p class='line'>Hung to his knee, the youthful flush revealing</p>
<p class='line'>Of warm, white limbs, half-nerved with coming manhood,</p>
<p class='line'>Yet fair and smooth with tenderness of beauty.</p>
<p class='line'>Now to the river’s sandy marge advancing,</p>
<p class='line'>He dropped the robe and raised his head exulting</p>
<p class='line'>In the clear sunshine, that with beam embracing</p>
<p class='line'>Held him against Apollo’s glowing bosom.</p>
<p class='line'>For sacred to Latona’s son is Beauty,</p>
<p class='line'>Sacred is Youth, the joy of youthful feeling.</p>
<p class='line'>A joy indeed, a living joy was Hylas,</p>
<p class='line'>Whence Jove-begotten Hêraclês, the mighty,</p>
<p class='line'>That slew the dreaded boar of Erymanthus,</p>
<p class='line'>To men though terrible, to him was gentle,</p>
<p class='line'>Smoothing his rugged nature into laughter</p>
<p class='line'>When the boy stole his club, or from his shoulders</p>
<p class='line'>Dragged the huge paws of the Nemæan lion.</p>
<p class='line'>The thick, brown locks, tossed backward from his forehead,</p>
<p class='line'>Fell soft about his temples; manhood’s blossom</p>
<p class='line'>Not yet had sprouted on his chin, but freshly</p>
<p class='line'><span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span></p>
<p class='line'>Curved the fair cheek, and full the red lip’s parting,</p>
<p class='line'>Like a loose bow, that just has launched its arrow;</p>
<p class='line'>His large blue eyes, with joy dilate and beamy,</p>
<p class='line'>Were clear as the unshadowed Grecian heaven;</p>
<p class='line'>Dewy and sleek his dimpled shoulder rounded</p>
<p class='line'>To the white arms and whiter breast between them.</p>
<p class='line'>Downward, the supple lines had less of softness:</p>
<p class='line'>His back was like a god’s; his loins were moulded</p>
<p class='line'>As if some pulse of power began to waken;</p>
<p class='line'>The springy fullness of his thighs, outswerving,</p>
<p class='line'>Sloped to his knee, and lightly dropping downward,</p>
<p class='line'>Drew the curved lines that breathe, in rest, of motion.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Musing a space he stood, a light smile playing</p>
<p class='line'>Upon his face—a spirit new-created</p>
<p class='line'>To the free air and all-embracing sunlight.</p>
<p class='line'>He saw his glorious limbs reversely mirrored</p>
<p class='line'>In the still wave, and stretched his foot to press it</p>
<p class='line'>On the smooth sole that answered at the surface:</p>
<p class='line'>Alas! the shape dissolved in glimmering fragments.</p>
<p class='line'>Then, timidly at first, he dipped, and catching</p>
<p class='line'>Quick breath, with tingling shudder, as the waters</p>
<p class='line'>Swirled round his thighs, and deeper, slowly deeper,</p>
<p class='line'>Till on his breast the River’s cheek was pillowed,</p>
<p class='line'>And deeper still, till every shoreward ripple</p>
<p class='line'>Talked in his ear, and like a cygnet’s bosom</p>
<p class='line'>His white, round shoulder shed the dripping crystal.</p>
<p class='line'>There, as he floated, with a rapturous motion,</p>
<p class='line'>The lucid coolness folding close around him,</p>
<p class='line'>The lily-cradling ripples murmured: “Hylas!”</p>
<p class='line'>He shook from off his ears the hyacinthine</p>
<p class='line'>Curls, that had lain unwet upon the water,</p>
<p class='line'>And still the ripples murmured: “Hylas! Hylas!”</p>
<p class='line'>He thought: “the voices are but ear-born music.</p>
<p class='line'>Pan dwells not here, and Echo still is calling</p>
<p class='line'>From some high cliff that tops a Thracian valley:</p>
<p class='line'>So long mine ears, on tumbling Hellespontos,</p>
<p class='line'>Have heard the sea-waves hammer Argo’s forehead,</p>
<p class='line'>That I misdeem the fluting of this current</p>
<p class='line'>For some lost nymph”—again the murmur: “Hylas!”</p>
<p class='line'>And with the sound a cold, smooth arm around him</p>
<p class='line'>Slid like a wave, and down the clear, green darkness</p>
<p class='line'>Glimmered on either side a shining bosom—</p>
<p class='line'>Glimmered, uprising slow; and ever closer</p>
<p class='line'>Wound the cold arms, till, climbing to his shoulders,</p>
<p class='line'>Their cheeks lay nestled, while the purple tangles</p>
<p class='line'>Their loose hair made, in silken mesh enwound him.</p>
<p class='line'>Their eyes of clear, pale emerald then uplifting,</p>
<p class='line'>They kissed his neck with lips of humid coral,</p>
<p class='line'>And once again <a id='there'></a>there came a murmur: “Hylas!</p>
<p class='line'>O come with us, O follow where we wander</p>
<p class='line'>Deep down beneath the green, translucent ceiling—</p>
<p class='line'>Where on the sandy bed of old Scamander</p>
<p class='line'>With cool white buds we braid our purple tresses,</p>
<p class='line'>Lulled by the bubbling waves around us stealing.</p>
<p class='line'>Thou fair Greek boy, O come with us! O follow</p>
<p class='line'>Where thou no more shalt hear Propontis riot,</p>
<p class='line'>But by our arms be lapped in endless quiet,</p>
<p class='line'>Within the glimmering caves of Ocean hollow!</p>
<p class='line'>We have no love; alone, of all th’ Immortals,</p>
<p class='line'>We have no love. O love us, we who press thee</p>
<p class='line'>With faithful arms, though cold—whose lips caress thee—</p>
<p class='line'>Who hold thy beauty prisoned. Love us, Hylas!”</p>
<p class='line'>The sound dissolved in liquid murmurs, calling</p>
<p class='line'>Still as it faded: “Come with us, O follow!”</p>
<p class='line'>The boy grew chill to feel their twining pressure</p>
<p class='line'>Lock round his limbs, and bear him, vainly striving,</p>
<p class='line'>Down from the noonday brightness. “Leave me, Naiads!</p>
<p class='line'>Leave me!” he cried; “the day to me is dearer</p>
<p class='line'>Than all your caves deep-sphered in Ocean’s quiet.</p>
<p class='line'>I am but mortal, seek but mortal pleasure:</p>
<p class='line'>I would not change this flexile, warm existence,</p>
<p class='line'>Though swept by storms and shocked by Jove’s dread thunder,</p>
<p class='line'>To be a king beneath the dark-green waters.”</p>
<p class='line'>Still moaned the humid lips, between their kisses;</p>
<p class='line'>“We have no love. O love us, we who press thee!”</p>
<p class='line'>And came in answer, thus, the words of Hylas:</p>
<p class='line'>“My love is mortal. For the Argive maidens</p>
<p class='line'>I keep the kisses which your lips would ravish,</p>
<p class='line'>Unlock your cold, white arms—take from my shoulder</p>
<p class='line'>The tangled swell of your bewildering tresses.</p>
<p class='line'>Let me return: the wind comes down from Ida,</p>
<p class='line'>And soon the galley, stirring from her slumber,</p>
<p class='line'>Will fret to ride where Pelion’s twilight shadow</p>
<p class='line'>Falls o’er the towers of Jason’s sea-girt city.</p>
<p class='line'>I am not yours—I cannot braid the lilies</p>
<p class='line'>In your wet hair, nor on your argent bosoms</p>
<p class='line'>Close my drowsed eyes to hear your rippling voices.</p>
<p class='line'>Hateful to me your sweet, cold, crystal being,</p>
<p class='line'>Your world of watery quiet:—Help, Apollo!</p>
<p class='line'>For I am thine: thy fire, thy beam, thy music</p>
<p class='line'>Dance in my heart and flood my sense with rapture:</p>
<p class='line'>The joy, the warmth and passion now awaken,</p>
<p class='line'>Promised by thee, but erewhile calmly sleeping.</p>
<p class='line'>O leave me, Naiads! loose your chill embraces,</p>
<p class='line'>Or I shall die, for mortal maidens pining.”</p>
<p class='line'>But still with unrelenting arms they bound him,</p>
<p class='line'>And still, accordant, flowed their watery voices:</p>
<p class='line'>“We have thee now, we hold thy beauty prisoned—</p>
<p class='line'>O come with us beneath the emerald waters!</p>
<p class='line'>We have no loves; we love thee, rosy Hylas.</p>
<p class='line'>O love us, who shall nevermore release thee:</p>
<p class='line'>Love us, whose milky arms will be thy cradle</p>
<p class='line'>Far down on the untroubled sands of ocean,</p>
<p class='line'>Where now we bear thee, clasped in our embraces.”</p>
<p class='line'>And slowly, slowly, sunk the amorous Naiads;</p>
<p class='line'>The boy’s blue eyes, upturned, looked through the water,</p>
<p class='line'>Pleading for help; but Heaven’s immortal Archer</p>
<p class='line'>Was swathed in cloud. The ripples hid his forehead,</p>
<p class='line'>And last, the thick, bright curls a moment floated,</p>
<p class='line'>So warm and silky that the stream upbore them,</p>
<p class='line'>Closing, reluctant, as he sunk forever.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The sunset died behind the crags of Imbros.</p>
<p class='line'>Argo was tugging at her chain; for freshly</p>
<p class='line'>Blew the swift breeze, and leaped the restless billows.</p>
<p class='line'>The voice of Jason roused the dozing sailors,</p>
<p class='line'>And up the ropes was heaved the snowy canvas.</p>
<p class='line'>But mighty Hêraclês, the Jove-begotten,</p>
<p class='line'>Unmindful stood, beside the cool Scamander,</p>
<p class='line'>Leaning upon his club. A purple chlamys</p>
<p class='line'>Tossed o’er an urn, was all that lay before him:</p>
<p class='line'>And when he called, expectant: “Hylas! Hylas!”</p>
<p class='line'>The empty echoes made him answer: “Hylas!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I.—THE SURPRISE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>My charge was in a beautifully romantic and fertile
spot, the natural features of which would seem
sufficient teachers of the power and the goodness of
God, if, indeed, nature were, as some insist, a sufficient
teacher without revelation. I soon found myself,
upon here taking up my residence, almost the only
man who thought it worth his while to study and
admire the beauties which nature, with a lavish
hand, had scattered over the scene. It was a valley,
enclosed on all sides with hills, whose ascents,
crowned with verdure, exhibited every variety of
tint and shade of green; for the trees of our country
display, more than any other, those varying colors
and gentle yet distinctly marked contrasts which the
painter envies, but strives in vain to transfer to his
canvas. There were only two breaks in the surrounding
amphitheatre. One was where a mountain
stream came tumbling and babbling into the valley;
the other where, in a more subdued and quiet current,
it found egress. The sinuous path of this little
river, or “run,” across the dale, was marked by a
growth of beautiful trees, among which the straight-leaved
willow, with its silver foliage shivering in
the light, was most frequent and conspicuous; other
trees which delight in water diversified the long,
green defile; and a little boat, which belonged to one
of my parishioners, offered me frequent twilight pastime.
Some labor, to which, though unused at first,
I soon became accustomed, was required to force
the boat upstream; but the highest “boatable” point
once reached, I had only to turn the shallop’s head
and guide it down, letting my little barque slowly
float, and conducting it clear of the shallows and obstructions.
Delightful were the views which the
turns in the stream were continually opening; the
overhanging trees, forming a green roof above, were
reflected below; and while I seemed thus suspended
between answering skies and trees, over my head
and beneath my feet, to look in either direction of
the stream seemed like peering into a mysterious
fairy grot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening as I paused, looking delighted upon
the scene of enchantment, a new feature was, as if
by magic, added to the picture. A little girl—a child
of surpassing loveliness—slipped out from among
the bushes, and, skipping from stone to stone, stood
on a high rock, near the middle of the current—the
beau ideal of such a sprite as one might fancy inhabiting
the spot. Her loose tresses floated on the evening
breeze, and her scanty drapery—it was mid-summer—as
the wind pressed it against her form, exhibited
a delicacy and grace of contour which that
artist would become immortal who could copy. She
did not at first perceive me; and when the flash of
my oar startled her, I almost expected she would
prove herself a vision, by vanishing into the sky
above in a cloud, or dissolving in a foam-wreath in
the water which rippled among the rocks behind
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But youth and innocence are courageous; and she
took no other notice of my approach than to seat
herself, to await my coming, upon the same stone
on which she had been standing. Her artless ease
and beauty won my heart—as men’s hearts are often
too easily won, through the eyes. Hers was grace
unaffected and natural. No drawing-room belle,
after years of practice before her mirror, could have
vied with this rustic nymph. She possessed what
art can with difficulty imitate, and that never entirely—perfect
and unconscious self-possession; and
she was the more admirable, that in her child-like
simplicity she dreamed not of admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pushed my shallop up beside the rock, and commenced
a conversation with her. I was grieved and
amazed to find her helplessly ignorant upon the
commonest subjects which those who fear God teach
their children. She could not even read, she told me.
She was born far away, she said—in another land,
mother used to say—and did not remember that she
ever went to church; but mother had told her that
she was carried there once to be baptized, and her
name was Bessie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your mother dead?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—not dead—I think not; but father—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hoarse voice from the shore now shouted her
name; and, unalarmed as she had been when I approached,
her little frame now shook with terror, and
her interesting face was pale and sullen with mingled
fear and anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that your father?” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not stop to answer, but instantly commenced
picking her way back to the bank. While
she did so, her trepidation several times almost tripped
her into the river. I should have watched her
every step at any other time, but my attention was
irresistibly drawn to the repulsive form which had
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
come, like a dark and unwelcome shadow, over this
fair scene. The face was positively one of the
most demoniacal in expression I have ever met.
Thick, black hair, unkempt, hung over the low forehead,
and the shaggy dark eye-brows seemed to
glower in habitual gloom over a rough and unshaven
face. The expression of the whole was that of a
man whose countenance is saddened into surliness,
like a clay image of Satan, by habitual strong potations.
A slovenly disregard to dress completed the
picture of a man who has sold himself to the vilest
and most disgusting habits of intoxication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While I trembled for the fate of such a child, in
such hands, she had come within his reach, and,
stretching forth his arm, he dragged her to him by
the hair, tripping her from her footing into the water,
and pulling her to the shore with more inhuman
rudeness than I can describe—her dress draggled and
muddied, and her limbs bleeding from contact with
the sharp stones and pebbles. Blow upon blow the
ruffian inflicted upon her, which I could hear as well
as see from where I stood. Not a sound, not a cry
escaped her; and while I was hesitating whether
I ought not to try to reach and rescue her, he ceased
beating her, and turned up a path in the bank-side.
She silently and doggedly followed him; and I sadly
took my way home, lamenting that the beauty and
peace of such a place should be so brutally interrupted;
and sorrowing more than all, that frequent
ill-usage had so deadened the child’s sensibilities as
to make her, otherwise so natural and unaffected,
thus endure pain with the sullen fortitude of an old
offender. I trembled for the life of a child growing
up under such influences; for I could see in her future
nothing but crime, suffering and degradation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was later than my usual time of return when I
reached the landing, and there were already lights in
the few houses which stood there. I might have
mentioned before—but that I hate to acknowledge
the fact—that the utilitarian habits of our era had
converted my romantic streamlet into a “power” to
turn a mill-wheel. It is not a grist-mill, which is a
proper appendage to rural scenery, but a woolen manufactory,
which, with its unromantic surroundings,
caused me many a joke from my friend, the owner
of the boat and of the mill. When I excepted to
such things as stretching frames, as a blot on the
beauty of the landscape, and to the dirty wool and
dye-stuff as ruining its romance, he would tell me
that if these valleys and rocks had never heard the
clatter of his machinery, neither would the “sound
of the church-going bell” have disturbed their echoes.
There was no answering this, because it was perfectly
true, and I could therefore only “humph” and be
silent. Though wrong in some points of his course,
Mr. Mariot, our “owner,” was a liberal man and
well disposed—would there were more such! He
built the little church in which I officiated, and he,
in effect, supported the rector. If he had not done
so, there could have been neither church nor service.
And he found his account in the superior
order of his establishment; and would have done
still more if, beside building the church, he had
abated or forbidden a nuisance which sadly impeded
my usefulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mariot stood at the landing, and as I stepped
ashore said, “I came down to meet you, Doctor, for
Yorkshire Jack is in one of his furious fits, and vows
he will beat you—priest or no priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who is Yorkshire Jack?” I asked, though a
suspicion who he might be instantly shot through
my mind. My suspicion was correct—for, upon
Mr. Mariot’s explanation, I found that he was the
very ruffian whose conduct I have been describing.
As we passed the house dignified with the title of
the “Mariotdale Hotel,” loud voices came through
the open windows. Mr. Mariot would have hurried
me past, but I laid my hand upon his arm, and
in a low but determined tone said, “Wait, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunday after Sunday I had preached—to little purpose—and
here was the reason. Several of my usual
congregation, upon whose hearts the word of God
fell like seed upon a beaten path-way, sat listening,
half laughing, half terrified, at the blasphemy of
<a id='the'></a>this fiendish fellow—Yorkshire Jack—and half a
score more, who never, by any chance, were seen
within the church walls, were applauding him at the
top of their voices. O, they will have a fearful
reckoning who have supplied fools who deny God
with words of blasphemy, and with the scoffings of
infidelity, through a prostituted press—who have
caught the thoughtless with profane wit, and betrayed
the daringly wicked with the hardihood of
declared infidelity! The worst words of the worst
men were rolled from this wretch’s lips, as if they
were his own utterance; the shallowest cant of infidel
literature came from his mouth as if his own
heart had originated what, indeed, it had only harbored.
Out of the borrowed abundance of a vile
heart, his lips spake; and the applause of his auditory
was scarcely less disgusting than his words
were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women began to gather round the windows of the
house—they dared not enter—and to call in hoarse
whispers to their husbands, fathers and sons to come
out. Children climbed up and looked in, now gazing,
open-mouthed, with terrified interest to the
drunken maniac’s fury—now laughing, in thoughtless
merriment, as his antics became ridiculous. At
length, spent with the vanity of a successful orator
to a fit audience, filled with drink, and worn out
with rage, Yorkshire John sank on a chair. The
efforts of his satellites failed to awaken him to new
ravings. The joke was worn out—the women coaxed
their husbands away, the children walked off, rehearsing,
describing, and laughing over what they
had heard. The place was soon hushed and still,
the monotonous voice of the water only breaking the
silence of the night, and Mariot and I took our way
homeward—for I lodged with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On our way nothing was said. The family, except
Mrs. M., had retired; and Mariot seemed as if
he would have made that circumstance a pretext for
following them in silence. He put a night lamp
in my hand, but I placed it on the table, and, sitting
down, took up <span class='sc'>The Book</span>. He sat also—but it was
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
evidently with unwilling politeness. Conscience
was at work—and he was desirous to evade, rather
than listen to, her warnings. I opened to the twenty-eighth
of Isaiah, and he started as I read, “Wo to
the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edward Mariot,” I said, “God will hold <span class='it'>you</span>
accountable for the sin which we have this night
witnessed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arose—I thought angrily. He commenced to
speak, but a look from his wife dissuaded him. How
would he defend himself with such facts so fresh?
But I knew that there was a coldness in his manner
as he returned my “good night,” with a half nod,
such as I never before had witnessed from him. I
feared that our friendship, and of course my further
residence in Mariotdale, was at an end; but I feared
more, that it would be written of my generous but
business devoted friend, “Ephraim is joined to his
idols—let him alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incidents which follow are not offered as from
the writer’s own observation. As the simple narrative
can be best told in the first person, the reader must consider
us both as having listened to the aged clergyman
who related it. He was a veteran in the Christian army,
and truly adorned his vocation by unaffected dignity and
sincere piety. Long experience and close observation had
given him power to penetrate character, and to read the
very thoughts of those whom he addressed. The listener
might often be startled at what seemed abrupt harshness,
but the result always showed that he knew in what manner
to approach all persons. Sympathy and gentleness
he well understood are lost on some natures; and positive
words are as widely improper for others. Clergymen are
too apt to regard all men but as so many copies of each
other. They are taught better as they grow older; but
our friend seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of human
nature.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II.—THE PEST HOUSE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There was an air of uncomfortable constraint over
our little family at the breakfast table on the morrow.
All thoughts were full of the same thing, but
none liked to broach it. Edward Mariot’s manner
seemed to say, “I am disposed to forget, if you will
be silent.” But I was determined, at any cost to
myself, to insist upon Mariot’s doing his duty in relation
to the disorderly house upon his premises—or,
failing in that, to leave the parish. I felt that my
usefulness was at an end if I hesitated to do what
Mariot, as well as I, knew was incumbent upon me;
for a clergyman who compromises his conscience to
keep his parish, is not only an unfaithful servant but
an ally to the enemy. Events, however, were so
ordered that I retained my friend, and was spared
the pain of giving him further reproof. I was informed
that Yorkshire John was at the door, and desired
to see me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rose instantly and went out. Mariot followed,
fearing violence—a danger which did not once occur
to me; for there are few—very few—so base and
cowardly as to make an attack upon a clergyman.
The man could not look me in the face. He was
abashed and evidently afflicted, and, merely muttering
that Bessie was “very bad,” and <span class='it'>wanted me</span>,
turned and strode hastily away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mariot accompanied me down to the little village,
and, as we walked, gave me some particulars of the
life and character of this singular being, Yorkshire
Jack. He had only the one child, and its mother
was still living, but had been forced to leave her
husband, on account of his cruel treatment. Nobody
knew precisely where she lived, or in what
manner she supported herself; but she was occasionally
seen hovering about the dale, with the intention
of seeing or carrying away her daughter.
The father detained the child in the hope that the
love of a mother would bring her back to him; for,
in the years that she had been absent, with a drunkard’s
inconsistency, he had earnestly desired her return,
and vehemently promised amendment. In
these professions, which had reached her through
a mutual acquaintance, she put no faith. She had
been compelled to fly more than once before; and
having, on those occasions returned only to discover
the hollowness of his promises, and to receive new
abuse, she had resolved to trust him no further. She
heard, moreover, through common fame, of all his
wild and wicked proceedings; and learning what
her child suffered, was the more firmly resolved not
only never herself to return, but to take away Bessie
if possible. This made John but the more cruel,
especially when in drink; and he was at all times
mad with suspicion that some one would aid her in
the abduction. Hence his rage against his daughter
and against me; for as he never conversed even
with his own child, he could conceive of no purpose
but a sinister one, in my accidental interview with
little Bessie. I was tempted to chide Mariot for suffering
this state of things without interfering; but
judged it discreet to be silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John’s house—or rather his room—was the picture
of neglect and desolation. He had converted it into
a sort of fortification, so that none but a most expert
burglar could get in without his permission. Neither
could <a id='the2'></a>the child get away when once the premises
were locked. During the day he had been in the
habit, often, of fastening her in, and when she went
abroad it was with him. It was shocking to hear
that the poor infant had been the forced auditor of
her father’s violence on the night before, till, spent
with fatigue, she fell on the floor and slept. No
wonder, you are ready to exclaim, that she was
ill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her disease was evidently something more
than mere exhaustion. Now feverish and languid,
she would anon become chilled. Pains in the head
and back, redness of eyes, a husky voice, and sore
throat, and a loathing rejection of food, with other
symptoms, which I will not expose my medical ignorance
by attempting to describe, marked her affection
as one of no light character. A hint sent the
father for a physician—for remorse often hastens
those whom affection cannot influence. Upon his
arrival he confirmed my surmises, and pronounced
the case one of decided small-pox, and of a very dangerous
and malignant type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father was frantic, and raved like a madman.
He denied stoutly that such could be the case—called
us fools and idiots, and ordered all—the physician, Mariot
and myself—to leave his house. I looked at my
friend, and saw tokens of the indecision and lack of resolution,
which was his infirmity. Then turning to
the father, I said, “We will not leave this sweet child
to perish in your hands; and unless you desist from
violence, if Mr. Mariot will not act, I will cause you
to be committed as a disturber of the peace!” The
man was in a frenzy, and absolutely foamed at the
mouth; but the physician and Mariot supported me,
and taking advantage of his temporary absence, we
turned his own fortifications against him and barred
him out, while we should consult what to do in the
emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mariot,” I said, after he and the physician had
proposed and rejected as impracticable several expedients,
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
“there is a <span class='it'>pest house</span> ready to your hand.
Take that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tenant will not suffer it,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave that to us.” And, with the doctor, I went
directly to the tavern, and without circumlocution
informed the landlord that we were about to bring
a small pox patient to his house, and desired a room!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, too, stormed and threatened, but we insisted.
The terror among the residents had now grown intense,
for the rumor had spread; and they having
collected, with one voice demanded that the house
should be taken. It stood apart from the rest, and
was in all respects eligible for the purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you do bring the child here,” said he, “I will
leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do so before, if you choose,” I answered, “for
in one hour she will be here.” And I further informed
him that upon his future quietness and good
behavior it would depend whether he should be proceeded
against for the sale of spirits to minors and
his other misdeeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new cause of alarm was now discovered. The
mother of the child lay sick in another house; and
investigation into the nature of her illness developed
the fact that, in a stolen interview with poor little
Bessie, it was she who had communicated to the
child the infection. Both mother and daughter were
removed to the tavern, a nurse was provided, and
all proper steps were taken for their comfort. Yorkshire
John, having become subdued by these events,
was suffered to be their attendant. The landlord,
having received Mariot’s assurance that his reasonable
charges should be met, sullenly acquiesced, and
did not carry out the threat of removal. The customers,
however, fortunately for themselves, avoided
the “Pest House,” and his business was reduced
completely to that of an infirmary. Thus, what fear
of moral contagion could not accomplish, was effected
by the dread of physical infection.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III.—THE VISION.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Pass over a couple of years, and behold me, the
energetic actor—perhaps almost unclerical—in the
events of the preceding narrative, now domiciled
permanently in the “Mariotdale Hotel.” The old
landlord—a good weaver—has resumed his place in
the works, and frequently avows his satisfaction at
the change which circumstances compelled him to
make in his pursuits. Yorkshire John, his very self,
is my landlord—and a quieter dwelling there is not
in the country. Perhaps much of this is due to the
good management of his wife—for she, after all, is
the man of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bessie?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Bessie! We laid her down to rest in the
churchyard two years since, for the illness she had
was unto death. It was this shock which recalled
the father to his senses; and rest assured I did not
spare him. He was not a man who could <span class='it'>bear consolation</span>,
for it seemed as if he could almost strike
the person who offered it. He rebelled against the
blow, but found that he was in the hands of a God
who will reach those by affliction who refuse to be
persuaded by mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Bessie—did I say? Blessed child! If the
dead can look on earth, she knows that her father
and mother have been reformed and reconciled
through her death; that father and mother have
learned to believe that the early lost are early saved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mariot, my warmer friend than before, admits
that my counsel was sound—that the souls as
well as the bodies of his people are in some sense in
his charge, and that he who neglects his duty in regard
to the first cannot atone for that neglect by care
of the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I often float in the evening down to Bessie’s rock,
and seldom fail to see in the twilight, <span class='sc'>The Vision</span>.
Nor does it now prove to be of the earth, earthly, as
once it did—for I know that she is in Heaven.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY HENRY C. MOORHEAD.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, during a ramble in the interior of Pennsylvania
with my gun and dog, I found myself on the
top of a high mountain, which commanded an extensive
view of the surrounding country. The
charms of the landscape soon drew off my attention
from the pursuit on which I had set out so zealously
in the morning; and leaving my dog to chase the
game at his pleasure, I indulged myself in pursuing
the phantoms of my imagination. In this mood of
mind I approached the end of the mountain, whose
rugged cliffs overhung the river which washed their
base. My dog running to the brink, looked over,
but instantly bounded back again, ran to and fro,
looking up in my face then crept back cautiously
to the spot, and gazed intently at some object below
him. Curious to learn what it was that so deeply
interested my faithful companion, and anxious to
secure it, if worth shooting, I looked to the priming
of my gun, and stretching myself on the rock, projected
my head over the precipice. A single glance
made me follow my dog’s example, and draw back;
for, on a kind of shelf, formed by a projecting rock, a
few feet below me, sat an old man, his white hairs
flowing over his shoulders, calmly surveying the
scene around him. From his dress and whole appearance,
I judged that he was, like myself, a stranger
in that neighbourhood, which made me still more
desirous to seek his acquaintance. I soon found a
winding path which led to the front of the bluff, and
in a few moments brought me to the side of the
stranger. To my increased surprise I found that he
was sitting at the mouth of a cavern, which had been
scooped out of the solid rock by the hand of Nature.
Here was as convenient a cell, and as profound a
solitude as any hermit could desire. But it was
clear that he was no hermit. His was neither the
garb, nor the look, nor the address of a man living
in seclusion from his fellows. When a sudden turn
in the path brought me close to his side, he rose
calmly, and saluted me as blandly and as kindly as
if we had been old acquaintances. Stammering out
a few words of apology for my intrusion, I was about
to withdraw, when he interposed with a courteous
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you not like to have a look at my hermitage?”
said he; then, perhaps, noticing my look of
incredulity, he added, “It is mine now, at least, by
the right of possession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me,” said I, “but I should not take you
for an inhabitant of these mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not, pray?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not customary, I think, for wild men of the
woods and rocks to wear white neckcloths and
polished boots,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman laughed at this remark, and
then said, “you may call me a <span class='it'>temporary</span> hermit,
then; for you certainly found me alone, and sitting
at the mouth of my cave. Indeed, if I were to assert
my claim to it, I doubt whether there is any man
living who could show a prior right; for I knew this
place when few white men had ever penetrated what
was then considered a remote wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prospect must have changed very much
since then,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In some respects it certainly has,” he replied;
“but the main features of a scene like this continue
ever the same. The plough cannot level mountains,
nor cultivation change the course of rivers. I have
been tracing the windings of this stream with my
eye, and find them just as they were; and I recognize
every soaring peak, and every projecting rock as an
old acquaintance; I saw broken clouds just like these
floating above the mountain tops fifty years ago;
and I would almost swear that yonder eagle is the
same which then sailed so majestically through
the air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those villages and forms, however, must be
new to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes!” said he, “there we see the hand of
civilization. Where now our eyes take in no less
than four neat and thriving villages, there were not
then as many clusters of rude wigwams; and these
green fields and blooming orchards were an unbroken
wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most happy change,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So reason doubtless tells us,” he replied. “Better
the peace and industry which now reign here, than
the war-whoop, or the listless indolence of savage
life. And yet it is melancholy to think how quickly
these old lords of the forest have disappeared. Many a
league was made in their rude fashion to endure between
the parties and their descendants, as long as
these mountains should continue to stand, or this river
to run. The eternal hills still cast their shadows on
the ever-rolling waters; but the powerful tribes who
appealed to them as perpetual witnesses of their faith
are extinct, or live only in a few wretched stragglers,
thousands of miles away in the far west. We have
possessed ourselves of their heritage; and to show
our gratitude, we abuse them for not having made a
better use of their own possessions, and congratulate
ourselves on the happy change we have effected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will never be wanting romantic persons,”
I remarked, “to celebrate the glories of savage life,
and the felicity of spending a northern winter half
naked and half starved, under the precarious shelter
of a wigwam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said he, with enthusiasm, “let them embalm
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
the memory of the Red Man! It will appease
the manes of those ambitious warriors to be renowned
in song and story. The noblest spirits of the
world have gained but a few lines in a Universal
History, or a single page in a Biographical Dictionary,
and have deemed themselves well paid for
a life of toil. Ambition is everywhere the same;
and its essence is a desire to be remembered. It
may happen that the sad fate of the Indian will perpetuate
his memory when the achievements of all
his conquerors have been forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot help suspecting,” said I, smiling, “that
you have yourself been a warrior, perhaps the
adopted son of the chief who presided over these
hunting-grounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he, “I was not so great a favorite with
the chief of these hunting-grounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, then,” continued I, “your sympathy is that
of a generous conqueror for an unfortunate adversary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly that either,” said he; “I was neither
for nor against them. If you are inclined to hear my
story, I will relate it here, in sight of every spot to
which it refers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We then sat down on the rock together, and he
proceeded as follows.</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>I came out as bearer of despatches to what was
then the frontier settlement; but an errand of my
own induced me to come on here. It was at the
time that the Moravians were making zealous <a id='and'></a>and
apparently very successful efforts to civilize and
Christianize the Indians; and they had a station,
under the care of the venerable Luten, which I know
must be somewhere in this neighborhood. Although
I had known and honored Luten from my boyhood,
I should scarcely have ventured on such an expedition
for the mere pleasure of seeing <span class='it'>him</span>; but he had
brought his wife with him, and what is more to our
present purpose, his daughter, Mary. Well, it was
a rash undertaking to penetrate this wilderness without
a guide, just then, for the Indians were in a state
of angry hostility toward the whites, in consequence
of some real or supposed injuries lately received;
but what will not an enterprising young fellow risk
in such a cause? Even the bold hunter often carries
his life in his hand; and the game I was pursuing was
better worth the risk than a wolf or a panther.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having struck on this chain of mountains, and
finding that they commanded a view of the surrounding
country, I followed them up until I reached the
brow above us, when I caught a glimpse of a figure
suddenly gliding down the face of the hill toward
where we are now sitting. I cautiously followed,
and saw a man whom I knew, from his appearance,
to be an <span class='it'>Indian conjurer</span>, enter this cave. Without
disturbing him, I returned to the hill above, and
carefully explored the country round for the station
I was in search of. I had given up the search, with
the full conviction that there was no settlement in
sight, when the light breeze wafted to my ear the
sound of human voices. I soon made out that it was
a familiar strain of sacred music, and sweeping over
the valley again with my telescope, discovered an
encampment just where yonder creek empties into
the river. It was the hour of evening worship; and
the savages were tuning their voices to the unwonted
notes of a Christian hymn. Of the venerable
missionary, it might emphatically be said, that he
pointed to heaven, and led the way. He had left
country, home, and friends; the habits of a lifetime,
and the tastes of a highly cultivated mind, for the
sake of the poor Indian; and it mattered little to him
whether his head reposed in a palace or a wigwam,
or whether his bones were laid in the Fatherland or
in some wild glen of the New World, so that his
Master’s work was sped. If such thoughts passed
through my mind whilst my eye rested for a moment
on him, they were instantly put to flight when I saw
another figure in the group. But he would have forgiven
my irreverence, if he had known of it, for the
love he also bore his gentle Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quickly descended the mountain, and reached
the encampment just as the sun was setting. Luten
received me as a son; Mary as a brother, except
that the blush which suffused her face and the agitation
of her nerves were something more than fraternal—so,
at least, I flattered myself. When I inquired
for the missionary’s wife a tear started into
the eye of both father and daughter. I understood it
all—she had found a grave in the wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had many questions to ask as well as to answer,
and much news to tell, and the evening wore away
before curiosity had been satisfied on either side.
But I felt anxious to know their plans and prospects
for the future; I therefore inquired of Luten how he
was succeeding with the Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far beyond my most sanguine expectations,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really think, then, that it is possible to change
their savage natures,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should it be thought doubtful?” said he.
“Are we not all descended from the same parents—all
partakers of the same fallen nature—all hastening
to the same bourne? But you would scarcely recognize
the gnarled and stunted oak, springing from
the scanty earth afforded by a crevice in the rock,
as belonging to the same species with the monarch
of the forest, striking his roots deep in a generous
soil, and spreading his branches proudly toward
heaven. Pour into the minds of these poor heathen
savages the light of civilization and Christianity, and
in a few generations they will have become the noblest
race of men in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very common belief, however,” said I,
“that they are incapable of civilization; and does
not experience seem to justify this opinion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My</span> experience proves the contrary,” said he,
with emphasis. “The people now in this encampment
were lately fierce and blood-thirsty warriors;
I wish the docility and meekness they now exhibit
were more common among white men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But has there been time,” I asked, “to warrant
the conclusion that the change will be permanent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no fear as to that,” he said; “the change
is radical—the savage nature is extinct in them; and,
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
like children, their plastic minds can now be moulded
into any form by education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it will prove so,” said I; “but do their
chiefs go with them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their favorite young chief, Tamaque, now leads
them as zealously in the path of peace, as he formerly
did in the war-path,” he replied. “A noble
young fellow he is, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed he is,” said Mary, who had hitherto been
listening to our conversation in silence; “he is always
so kind and gentle. I love him as my own
brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very bluntness of her words might have satisfied
me that she meant <span class='it'>only</span> what she said; but
somehow or other I did not like her form of expression,
and I began to feel anything but partial toward
the person they referred to. “Pray what does he
look like?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he is very handsome,” said she, with the
same provoking simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no doubt very accomplished,” said I, drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes,” she replied, “he is by no means
wanting in accomplishments. He was educated at
one of our own schools, and, it is said, proved a very
apt scholar. Indeed, his civilized accomplishments
are very respectable; and as to his savage ones,”
she added, laughing, “he is foremost in all the exercises
of his tribe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I joined in the laugh, rather faintly, and then
added, maliciously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt even his copper color is unusually
bright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By no means,” she replied; “his color is that
of a white man a little tanned by exposure to the
sun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truth is,” said Luten, “he is only half Indian,
and he seems to be endowed with most of the
virtues of both the white and red man, without the
vices of either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affair had now become serious, and I could
no longer help regarding this accomplished half-breed
chief as a formidable rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On him, more than any man,” continued Luten,
“rest my hopes for the regeneration of his race.
I imagine to myself that I see in him the future
founder of Indian civilization. Yes, my young
friend, ere you have attained the age which now
bears me to the ground, you will see these savage
tribes every where pursuing the arts of peace; you
will see them kneeling at the altar of the living God,
and putting to shame the boasted civilization of the
white man. My old body will be dust long before
that; but this hope, and belief, have sustained
me amidst all the toils and privations of a life in the
wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked anxiously in the speaker’s face; for the
thought struck me that his mind had become unsettled.
But his placid countenance and clear, steady
eye, at once convinced me that what I had deemed
madness, was nothing more than the enthusiasm of
a bold and sanguine reformer. I could not find it in
my heart to disturb the vision which afforded him so
much delight by any expression of my doubts, and
still less did I feel inclined to enter upon any further
discussion of the merits of Tamaque. I had heard
too much about them already for my repose that
night; and every remark I had made on the subject
had only served to call forth a fresh eulogy. I therefore
gladly accepted Luten’s invitation to retire to
my bear-skin couch. Many were the visions that
chased each other through my brain during my broken
slumbers, and Tamaque was connected with
them all. Sometimes I saw him the king of a mighty
people, with Mary at his side, crowned as a queen.
Again I found myself engaged in deadly conflict
with him, and waked just in time to escape receiving
the death-blow at his hands. At another time I
seemed to have got the better of him, and was about
to plunge my sword into his bosom with fierce exultation,
when my hand was arrested by a reproachful
look from her, and started up and thanked heaven
that it was only a dream. At length, however, I
fell into a sound and tranquil sleep. But I was not
permitted long to enjoy it; for, just at the dawn of
day, a strange Indian rushed into the camp, yelling
the war-whoop until the mountains echoed it back
again. The whole camp was instantly in motion;
in a few minutes the council-fire was blazing, and
the Indians had ranged themselves around it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The messenger soon told his story. A number of
fanatic white men had banded together and sworn
eternal hostility to the Indians. They professed to
consider them as standing in the same relation to
themselves as the Canaanites of old did to the children
of Israel; and, therefore, in the name of God,
they waged an exterminating war against them.
They had just fallen upon an Indian village of Tamaque’s
tribe, and slaughtered the inhabitants, without
regard to age or sex. This messenger had alone
escaped to tell the dreadful tidings. His words produced
a deep sensation on these fierce warriors, just
emerging into civilization. The old instincts of their
natures were evidently reawakened; and it seemed
as if a signal only were wanting to make them rush
forth, as in former days, with tomahawk and scalping-knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luten hastened to check the torrent of passion
which threatened, in one moment, to sweep away
the fruits of all his labors. Standing, like a venerable
patriarch, among his rebellious household, he
endeavored, by a skillful blending of persuasion with
parental authority, to restore them to a sense of duty.
Reminding them of their solemn vows, he conjured
them by that regard for plighted faith which is the
red man’s boast, not to forget or break them in this
moment of passion. He pointed out the high destiny
they had to accomplish, in spreading light and knowledge
all through the wilderness, and leading the
way to a great reformation of the Indian race. Then,
in a more solemn tone, he spoke of the world to
come; painting the happiness in store for those who
persevere to the end, and the uncontrollable miseries
reserved for the unfaithful. His earnest eloquence was
perfectly adapted to their simple apprehensions, yet
eminently calculated to strike their imaginations by
the wild imagery with which he embellished it.
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
Their stern natures relented as he spoke, and he
seemed to be on the point of regaining all his influence
over them, when another messenger arrived,
and signified that he had important news to communicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told of new outrages, more cruel, if possible,
than the first; and whilst every heart beat high with
rage and horror, turned to Tamaque and addressed
him thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These griefs are common to us all; but the
words I am now to speak will fall more dismally
on Tamaque’s soul than the howling of a famished
wolf. Yesterday you had a father and a sister. I
saw that father’s gray hairs red with blood; I saw
that sister, when flying from the blazing wigwam,
driven back by the white men’s spears—and she returned
no more. Then I came, swift as a hunted
deer, to sound the war-whoop in the ears of Tamaque
and his warriors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the whole scene Tamaque had been
sitting as impassive as a statue. It was impossible
to gather from his looks any hint of what was passing
in his mind; and when, at length, he rose, the
fire that beamed from his eye alone enabled me to
anticipate his purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Warriors!” he said, “we must listen to the song
of peace no longer. The white man’s words are
love, but his embrace is death. Let us return, without
delay, to the customs of our fathers. Even now
I hear their voices, from the land of spirits, calling
us to war and vengeance.” Then turning toward
me, he continued: “The stranger has come just in
time—seize him and drag him to the torture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With savage yells some gathered round me,
whilst others hastened to prepare the stake, and
others to collect the implements of torture. I had
seen the operation once in my life, and remembered
it well. In that case, the victim was stripped naked
and tied with a grape vine to the top of a pole, having
a free range on the ground of ten or fifteen feet.
At the foot of the pole was a flaming fire of pitch-pine,
and each Indian held in his hand a small bundle
of blazing reeds. The death-signal being given
he was attacked on all sides, and driven to the pole
for shelter; but, unable to endure the flames that
scorched him there, he again rushed forth and was
again driven back by his tormentors. When he became
exhausted water was poured on him and a
brief respite given, that he might recover strength
for new endurements. The same scene was acted
over again and again, until they had extracted the
last thrill of anguish from his scorched and lacerated
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar preparations were now making for me,
and I watched them with shuddering interest as the
fire was kindled and the faggots distributed. Just
as they were about to drag me to the stake, however,
Luten interposed. But all his appeals and entreaties
were unheeded; and when at last he begged them,
if they must have a victim, to take him and spare his
young friend, Tamaque rudely repulsed him, and
ordered him to be carried away to his tent. My last
hope of escape was now extinguished, when lo! a
figure glided suddenly into the arena, arresting the
attention of all, as if she had been a messenger from
Heaven. Can the daughter control these wild spirits
who have rebelled against the authority of the father?
She binds her white handkerchief round my arm,
and then whispers in the ear of Tamaque. The
words, whatever they are, act like a charm on him.
His stern countenance relaxes almost into a smile,
and he stands for some moments absorbed in meditation.
Again she whispers a few earnest words;
upon which he comes forward, takes me by the arm,
and leads me, in silence, to the outskirts of the
encampment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now go!” he cried, pointing toward the east;
“you are indebted for your freedom to one I love
better than you. See that you make a good use of
it; for, if you should be retaken, and brought here
again, not even <span class='it'>her</span> entreaties shall save you from
the torture. Away! and here,” he continued, handing
me a red belt, “bear to the false-hearted cowards
you came from this token of the hatred and defiance
of Tamaque and his warriors.” He waved his hand
to prevent my replying, and stalked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was now free, but by no means satisfied with
the manner in which my liberty had been procured.
What meant this mysterious influence of a fair young
Christian girl over a haughty savage chieftain?
What were those whispered words which had
wrought the sudden charm? Had she yielded to
some request, or given some pledge in order to make
her prayer effectual? My mind was racked with
torments scarce less poignant than those which just
before had threatened to assail my body. I resolved
at all hazards to see the end of it; and, therefore, in
defiance of fire and faggot, concealed myself at a
point close by, which commanded a full view of the
neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had not been long in my hiding place when I saw
a procession, with Tamaque at its head, move from
the camp in the direction of this mountain. I conjectured
at once that they were coming here to consult
the conjurer, and resolved to follow them. When
they had descended the face of the precipice to the
spot where we are now sitting, I crept cautiously
forward on the rock above, and found myself in full
hearing of their consultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How often have I warned you,” said the conjurer,
“against the teachings of the white men. I
told you they only wished to rob you of your courage
that they might destroy you the more easily; but
you refused to listen to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said Tamaque, “that is past; there
is no help for it now. Let us talk of the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last year,” continued the conjurer, “when no
game was to be found, and when the corn all
withered away, I told you the Great Spirit was
angry because you were forsaking the customs of
your fathers; but you turned a deaf ear to my
words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember it all,” said Tamaque, “but go on,
and tell us of the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They promised you,” persisted the conjurer,
“that if you would worship their God you should
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
go to their heaven when you died. I told you that
your spirits and theirs could never live in peace in
the same spirit-land; but you would not believe
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, I am tired of this,” said Tamaque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No forests, no rivers, no deer, no hunting and
no war,” continued the conjurer, “what would the
Indian warrior do in the white man’s heaven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cease your babbling!” cried Tamaque, in a tone
no longer to be disregarded. “If you can foretell
our fortunes in this war speak; if not, out on your
boasted wisdom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conjurer seemed to feel that it was necessary
to come to the point. After a long pause, he asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done with the white stranger
that came to your camp last evening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old impostor had no doubt seen me at the
same time I had seen him as I crossed the mountain,
but he was determined to make a mystery of it.
Tamaque seemed puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know of his coming?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tamaque doubts the conjurer’s wisdom,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said Tamaque, “you would not tell me
what I come to hear. Go on, now, and I’ll believe
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has the stranger been put to death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is gone,” said Tamaque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was wrong,” said the conjurer; “he should
have died at the stake. The Great Spirit calls for a
sacrifice. The missionary and his daughter must
die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said Tamaque, “it is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be so,” replied the conjurer; “they must
die before sunset.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be,” said Tamaque firmly; “command
me to do any thing but that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I command you to do that,” replied the conjurer,
“or I will call down confusion on your war-party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you,” said Tamaque fiercely, “they shall
not die. Say no more about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Obstinate man!” said the conjurer, “you dare
not disobey me. They shall die, and you shall
kindle the fire beneath them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tamaque now sprang forward and seized the conjurer
by the throat. “Villain!” he exclaimed, “I
warned you to speak of that no more. Name it
again, and I will toss you headlong down the mountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding that Tamaque could not be overawed, the
wily conjurer now changed his tactics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might safely spare them,” he said, “on one
condition; but I dare not name it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” said Tamaque, “you have nothing to
fear, if you do not speak of their death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The anger of Tamaque is dangerous,” continued
the conjurer; “and who can tell what words
will rouse it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” said Tamaque mildly, “I will hear
you patiently; and if you require me even to leap
down this dizzy precipice, I’ll obey you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, then,” said the conjurer; “and if my
words sound harsh in your ears,” said the old
hypocrite, “let not your anger be kindled. They
shall live if you choose, but then the white maiden
must become Tamaque’s wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was looking over, at the moment, from the rock
above, full at Tamaque. He started convulsively;
his whole frame shook with emotion; whilst a gleam
of joy absolutely lighted up his dark features. My
own sensations were not less violent, perhaps, though
somewhat different in their character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a pause Tamaque asked, in a tone of affected
indifference:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I consent to this, do you promise success to
our expedition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the conjurer, “you will conquer all
your foes, and reestablish the power and glory of
the red man. Behold! a vision of the future rises
up before me. I see Tamaque great and powerful,
the ruler over many nations; and far off, for many
generations, I see his children’s children walking in
his footsteps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your words are good,” said Tamaque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So will be your deeds,” said the conjurer.
“Strike boldly, and fear nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tamaque knows no fear,” replied the haughty
chief. “To-morrow he will go forth with his
warriors, and thus will he rush upon the foe.” As
he spoke he heaved from its resting place a huge
fragment of rock, which bounded down the mountain
roaring and smoking, and crushing all before it,
until, with a loud plunge, it disappeared beneath the
bubbling waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had now heard and seen enough; and there was
no time to be lost if I wished to save <span class='it'>her</span> from—from
what? Confusion on the thought! My head
reeled, and I came near falling down amongst them.
But I soon rallied, and made all possible haste to
reach the camp before Tamaque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, as I emerged from a clump of trees
yonder on the bank of the creek, I saw her whom I
sought close before me, kneeling on a mound of
earth,—doubtless her mother’s grave. I stood entranced,
and listened, in spite of myself, to the broken
sentences which she uttered aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And save, oh, merciful Father,” she murmured,
“save his white hairs from the dangers which surround
us.” Her filial words here became inaudible.
The next sentence that reached my ears related to a
different person. “May thy powerful arm protect
us from the cruel rage, and the still more cruel love
of that dreadful man!” My jealous ears drank in
these words with ecstasy. They were a balm to
my wounded spirit; a compensation for all my sufferings.
Again she spoke aloud: “And him, the
stranger, who wanders, unprotected, through the
wilderness; oh! guard his steps from harm, and
grant, in thine own good time, that—” her voice
now died away into a gentle whisper. When it rose
again she was saying, “And for me, in mercy, give
thy unhappy child, here, in this hallowed spot, a
peaceful grave.” I began to feel that my listening,
however <a id='inad'></a>inadvertent, was little less than sacrilege;
and, therefore, quietly stole away out of hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
As soon as I discovered that she had risen to her
feet, I again drew near. Great was her surprise and
consternation at seeing me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! why do you linger here,” she cried. “You
should, ere this, be far on your way toward home.
Fly instantly, and look not behind you; for, if you
should be taken by these cruel savages no human
power can save you from a dreadful doom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that well,” I replied; “but can you
think me so careful of my own life as to run away
and leave you to their tender mercies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear nothing for me,” she said; “they do not
rank me among their enemies, and will not harm
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But although you may be safe from their hatred,
have you nothing to fear from their friendship?”
said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tide of confusion mounted to her brow at
these words, and she trembled in every limb. But,
quickly recovering herself, she said: “Come what
may, I share the fate of my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But go,” said I, “bring your father quickly, and
we will all escape together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said she, sadly, “he is old and feeble; his
absence would soon be noticed; they would certainly
pursue us, and easily overtake us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could make no reply to this, for I knew that we
could not take her father with us, and I felt sure
that she would not go without him. With the
dogged resolution of despair, therefore, I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your own fidelity teaches me my duty. I
shall remain in these woods to watch over your
safety. Seek not to change my purpose. Better
endure all the torments these fiends can inflict
than the shame and remorse I should suffer if I left
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke in a tone that could leave no doubt of my
sincerity or firmness. She evidently felt it so, and
stood for some minutes with her eyes fixed on the
ground in silent meditation. Then, at length, raising
her head, she abruptly asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you paddle a canoe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied that I could with considerable skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go down immediately to the mouth of the
creek,” she continued; “I will bring my father
there, and it is possible that we may yet escape
across the river. It is worth the trial, at least, and
is our only hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hastened to the place designated, where I found
two canoes moored to the shore. In a few minutes
Mary appeared, almost dragging her father along.
When the old man understood our purpose he refused
to get into the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he, “I cannot leave these poor children,
whom I have so long taught and prayed for.
Deserted by their pastor, they would soon return to
their old habits, and the labor of long years would
lose all its fruits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, sir,” I replied, “they have already withdrawn
themselves from your authority. You cannot
safely remain amongst them, for they now regard all
white men as their enemies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will stay,” he answered, “and bring them back
to the fold from which they are wandering, or else
lay down my life among them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your daughter,” I continued; “surely this
is now no place for her. Come! let us place her in
safety, and then, if you choose, you can return.”
I saw that he hesitated; and so, taking him by the
arm, I led him, with gentle violence, into the canoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are these the only canoes at the station?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being answered in the affirmative, I directed Luten
to hold fast to the empty one, and then pushed off
from the shore. My intention was to cut off pursuit
by carrying the empty canoe some distance into the
stream and then setting her adrift. The river was
then about at its present height, and dashed over
these rapids with the same violence as now. It was
certain that no boat could drift through them without
being swamped or broken to pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, when we had attained what I thought
a sufficient distance from the shore, I directed Luten
to let go his hold. Scarcely had he done so when a
shriek from Mary, whose face was turned toward
the shore, was immediately followed by a plunge,
and then another, into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Tamaque and another Indian,” she exclaimed,
“and they are swimming for the empty
canoe.” I cast a hasty glance behind me, and saw
all the peril of our position; but I had no time for
making observations. My business was to ply the
paddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” continued Mary, “they have almost
reached it; and now they have caught—but see!
they have upset it in trying to climb in. No! it has
come right again; and now Tamaque has got in
safely, and is dragging his companion after him.
But it is too late; they are almost at the falls, and
they cannot stem the current. Look! Merciful
Heaven, they will go over, and be drowned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obeying the gentler impulses of her nature, she
thought only of their danger, forgetting that <span class='it'>that</span> was
our only chance of escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how they do struggle for their lives,” she
continued; “and now they are standing still—no,
they are moving—they are coming—faster and faster—they
are coming toward us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I again looked back for a moment, and, truly, they
were coming, and evidently gaining on us. Luten
meanwhile sat in the bottom of the canoe in a fit of
total abstraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not leave them, nor return from following
after them,” he muttered; “they have gone astray,
but I will bring them back, and they shall yet be
the instruments, under God, of regenerating the
whole Indian race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the state of things was now becoming critical,
and Mary cried out in terror:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, help!—take that other paddle and
help, or we are lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man roused himself up, took the paddle,
and went to work in the bow of the canoe. But he
was unskilled in the business, and did more harm
than good. I begged him to desist, but he only
replied by increasing his well meant exertions. At
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
length, however, he rocked the boat, and threw her
out of her course so badly, that I was obliged to
command him, peremptorily, to sit down; and he
was soon again lost in meditation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile our pursuers were rapidly gaining on
us. Under the guidance of her two powerful and
well-trained workmen, their canoe bounded forward
at every sweep of the paddles like a race-horse. I
now saw that it was all over with us. We were
still a long way from shore, and they were almost
upon us. Nor could it avail us any thing even if we
should succeed in landing first. They would capture
us on the land if they did not on the water. My
heart sickened at the thought. To me captivity
would bring unutterable torments; and to my innocent
and lovely companion a fate still more deplorable.
Was there any alternative? I looked the
whole subject steadily in the face for one minute,
and then my resolution was taken. With a single
dexterous sweep of the paddle I brought the head of
the canoe directly down stream, and then urged her
forward toward the roaring cataract. Tamaque
uttered a loud yell of rage and disappointment; and,
the same moment, his tomahawk whizzed by within
an inch of my head. But the current now drew us
on with fearful rapidity. Mary sat pale and silent,
gazing anxiously in my face; whilst her father continued
unconscious of all that was passing. Now
and then I could hear his voice amid the tumult of
the dashing breakers mournfully bewailing the apostacy
of his neophytes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had now reached the very brink of the foaming
precipice, when my eye caught a narrow streak
of blue water, which evidently descended in a gradual
slope. I directed the canoe toward it, and she
went down, plunging, I thought, entirely under; but
she rose again filled with water, but still afloat. I
threw my hat to Mary; and, whilst I kept the canoe
steady in her course with one hand, I seized my hat
in the other and commenced bailing. In a few
minutes all danger of sinking was removed. We
had now a free course before us, and an impassible
barrier (so it was deemed) between us and our pursuers.
We felt that we were safe;—all but Luten;
to whom our danger and our safety seemed equally
indifferent. His thoughts were far away in the land
of dreams, where he had so long dwelt, and from
which he would not yet depart. We spoke to him,
but he made no answer. At length his head began
to sink slowly down, and Mary hastened to support
it. An ashy paleness now came over his features;
his breathing grew short and difficult, and his mutterings
became inaudible; except once, when the
name of Tamaque trembled on his lips. Then his
eyes became fixed; his lips ceased to move; his
hand dropped heavily down at his side; and now,—the
hot tears that rain from the eyes of his dutiful
child fall on the brow of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now near sundown; and when we reached
the nearest white settlement it was near morning.
There we buried Luten; and his daughter being
now an orphan, and without a protector in the
world, why, of course,—but I need not relate what
followed. Suffice it to say that I was no longer
jealous of Tamaque, but even felt a pang of regret
when I heard, soon after, that he had fallen in battle.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A TRUE TALE OF THE NORTH-WEST.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MAJOR RICHARDSON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the tribes of Indians with whom it has
been our lot to mix, and these have not been a few,
we know of none who can surpass in the native dignity
and nobleness of manhood the Saukie tribe. We,
however, speak not of them as they exist at the present
day. Many years have elapsed since fighting
against Hull, Winchester, and Harrison, we numbered,
as co-operating with the division of the army
to which we were attached, three thousand fighting
men of the élite of the warriors of the principal
tribes, headed by the indomitable and ever lamented
Tecumseh, whom, as a boy, then first attempting his
<span class='it'>coup d’essai</span> at arms, we ever loved and revered,
and with whom half an hour before his fall, we
shook the hand of cordiality, and separation—forever.
We repeat, at that period there were, varying slightly
in number at intervals, not less than three thousand
with the eighth division of the British army—and these
were the choice warriors of the following tribes:
Shawanees, Delawares, Munsees, Hurons, Wyandots,
Miamis, Chippewas, Ottowas, Kickapoos,
Foxes, Minouminies, Pottowattamies, Winnebagoes,
Loups, Sioux, and lastly, for we cannot recollect
some two or three others—the Saukies. Each tribe
had its peculiar and distinctive characteristics—but
no one so markedly so as the last named people, and
next to them the Winnebagoes. We have remarked
that we do not know what the Indian tribes, even in
their original hunting grounds have become since
so long abstinence from the pursuits of war and adventure,
but <span class='it'>then</span>, the Saukies were the noblest
looking men of all we have ever since beheld in
any quarter of the globe we have visited. They
were a collective impersonation of the dignity of man,
as sent first upon earth by the will of God; nor were
these characteristics of manly beauty peculiar only
to a few, but general to all. A Saukie warrior,
arrived at the full stage of manhood, was tall—generally
from five feet eleven to six feet in height, and
of proportionate symmetry of person. Their carriage
was erect, dignified, graceful. Their look serene,
imposing without sternness. Their features bore
the Roman impress, and seldom did we look upon a
Saukie, arrived at mature age, without the memory
adverting at once to the dignified senators of the
forum of which we had so recently been reading.
There was a nobleness—a consciousness—a native
dignity about these people that always inspired us
with a certain degree of awe and respect; and so
deeply was this sentiment implanted in us at that
very early period of a somewhat adventurous life,
that our <span class='it'>beau ideal</span> of manly beauty has ever since
continued to be a Saukie warrior of the commencement
of the present century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The period of occurrence of the incidents of our
little tale was some four or five years prior to the
American declaration of war against Great Britain,
and when the North West Company of Canada,
whose wealth, acquired in the pursuit of that trade,
was at one time great, held various stockade forts
in the heart of the Indian country. The ambulating
village of the Saukies was then situated on a branch
of one of those small streams on which the forts
were usually built, and at a distance of about forty
miles from that which will come more immediately
under our notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>White Bear was one of the most honored of the
Saukie chiefs, and even among men whom we have
just described as so eminently prepossessing, he was
remarkable. He was forty years of age, and possessed
a majesty of mien and carriage that won to him the
respect of his tribe not more than did his wisdom in
the council, and his daring in war. He had but one
wife, and she was much younger than himself, but
years had so little to do with the estimate in which
he was generally held by the squaws of his tribe,
and particularly by his wife, whose passion for him
was ardent as his own for her, that this disparity
had never even been noticed. Indeed, their friendship
for each other was the remark of the whole tribe.
For an Indian, he took great pride in her beauty, and
spent with her many hours that ought to have been
devoted to the chase. War for some years past there
had been none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunflower was tall and graceful. She had very
black, soft, languishing eyes—marked, yet delicate
eyebrows. Her nose, like that of her tribe, was
Roman, but more delicately marked than that of the
men, her teeth were white and even, her mouth
small, and her hair glossy as the raven’s wing, and
darker than the squirrel’s fur. The full and massive
club into which it was tastefully rolled and placed behind
the back of her neck, proved its fullness and
redundance. She was elegantly formed. She had
never been a mother, and her nut-brown bosom had
all the roundness of contour of a Venus, and the
smoothness of the Parian marble. Her hands and
feet, like those of all her race, were small, and yet
there was a development of her whole person that
set all art to improve it at defiance. Late at night
she always bathed in the sweet waters of the stream,
and on its low banks combed the long and luxuriant
hair that overshadowed her person, and with the
chewed root of the grape-vine, added fragrance to her
breath, even while she increased the dazzling whiteness
of the teeth she rubbed with it. To crown all
the fascinations of this Indian wife—this favored
daughter of a race in which the interesting and the
beautiful are so rarely found, she had a voice whose
every note was laughing music.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
There was one in that camp, and of that tribe, who
saw the happiness of White Bear, not with envy, for
his nature was too generous for so low a passion,
but with regret that destiny had not given to him the
beautiful, the enchanting Sunflower. He was consumed
with the most ardent love. He lived only in
and for her—hung upon her look, fed upon her glance,
and yet he had never spoken to her. His soul melted
away with love for her. To look at her alone was
enjoyment the greatest he could taste. The chase
was deserted, his very flute, in which he excelled,
and on which he often played to the great delight of
the admiring Indian girls, was neglected. Not so
his dress. No young Saukie bestowed more pains
in decorating his person than did the tall and gracefully
formed Wawandah, and this not from any
foolish love of display, as because he wished to appear
favorably in her eyes, should she ever be induced
to regard him. The savage equally with the
civilized, tries to win a woman as much by dress as
by address. But in vain Wawandah courted his
toilet. The vermilion was applied to his cheek and
lips without the desired result—the Sunflower never
once caught his eye, or if she did, she was too much
engaged in thinking of the White Bear, to be conscious
that any other of her tribe sought to win
her attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Days, weeks passed on, with the same unvarying
result. Wawandah was sorely grieved at heart.
He began to pine away. His soft and melancholy
eye became dull. He had no pleasure in the chase
which took him far from the encampment. Every step
that he trod in pursuit led him farther from the spot
trodden by her, the very soles of whose feet he
worshiped, and he could not continue. Thus, when
a stray buffalo would cross him, easy to be killed, and
offering himself as an unerring mark to his rifle, his
passion would so trouble his mind as to unnerve his
arm. Then the ball would pass unwounding by, and
the half sneers of his companions arise and bring the
blush to his cheek; as they bade him tauntingly
leave the rifle to be handled by men, and go and amuse
himself with the women. In like manner he sought
to avoid the war-dance, and the ball playing, and the
foot-race, for his mind was too painfully interested
to engage unrestrainedly in these amusements, and
unless excellence was to be obtained in whatever he
undertook, Wawandah cared not to be a competitor.
Wawandah was beginning to lose caste not only with
the elders of the tribe but with the young men who
were jealous of his superiority, and so much was he
talked of that the very women knew all that was
said by the warriors, and the Sunflower like the rest.
It was the first time Wawandah had ever come
under the notice of her he so fondly loved, and as he
knew the cause, he secretly blessed the fate which
had, even under circumstances so humiliating to the
pride of a warrior, been the cause of her bestowing
even the slightest attention upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The White Bear had been the friend of the father
of Wawandah, who for ten long years, according to
Indian computation, had slumbered in his grave with
the red stained pole at its head. Since he had taken
the Sunflower to his bosom, he had neglected the
boy, for his own breast was full of the natural selfishness
of love, and he had not found time to regard
him as he would have done had he been free from
the influence that now exclusively governed him
in all things. But when the Sunflower told him that
there was a youth in the village who, oppressed by
some secret care, had so degenerated in the tastes
and pursuits of the young warriors, as absolutely to
have incurred their scorn, her husband recollected
the name, and determined as far as he could to comfort
him, and to restore to him the respect of his tribe;
and straightway he sent a young boy to the wigwam
of Wawandah, who was then lying on the skin of a
grizzly bear, which he had killed before the spirit of
guilty love had entered into his heart, and the recollection
of his skill and prowess in obtaining which
was the only circumstance that still preserved to him
a certain consideration among the elders of the tribe.
Astonished, almost dismayed at the message, Wawandah
rose from his couch, and disguising his feelings,
said to the young messenger, “That it was good.
He would go to White Bear’s wigwam presently.”
The boy departed, and Wawandah was torn with
emotion. What was the meaning of this message?
Since the death of his father, the Black Vulture, the
White Bear had taken no other notice of him than
he had of the young warriors generally; then how
was it that he sent for him now, when almost shunned
by the young men of his tribe; he bowed submissively
and uncomplainingly to the effects of the
passion that was preying upon his heart, rendering
him regardless of all things else. Why, he again
asked himself, was this? Or had the White Bear
discovered his secret in the only way in which it
could have transpired—through his eyes—and sent
for him to reprove and to threaten. Still he was glad
that he was sent for, no matter for what reason, for
there was a faint hope at his heart that the Sunflower
might be present at the interview in the wigwam,
and he felt that it would be pleasant to be condemned
in her hearing for that which she alone had, however
innocently, occasioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, with slow, and timid, and undecided step, he
approached the tent of the great chief. The latter
motioned him to be seated. Wawandah, who, on
entering, had seen in a corner of the tent a muffled
figure, which his beating heart told him was the
wife of the White Bear, silently obeyed, and waited
until the chief had finished his pipe. Wawandah
now and then turned his eyes furtively in the direction
of the squaw who was embroidering moccasins
with the dyed quills of the porcupine, and could perceive
that she, too, occasionally glanced at him in
the same furtive manner. The heart of Wawandah
was troubled yet full of gladness. To be looked at
with interest by the Sunflower had been the summit
of his highest ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wawandah,” said the White Bear, who had
finished his pipe, and was now emptying the bowl
of its ashes, “the chief, your father, was a great
warrior in the tribe; and when, a year after his death,
you slew the white bear that was about to kill a
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
young girl, all the tribe thought that you too would
become a great warrior. What says my son—why
is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugh!” was the sole and assentient reply of the
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The braves say you cannot shoot, and that your
arm is wide as that of a squaw from the buffalo or
the deer—that every papoose can beat you in the
race—that you cannot wrestle, and that the ball never
rebounds from your foot. Is this true? Are you no
longer a warrior? Why is this, my son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wawandah was silent for a moment, and then
placing his palm over his heart, he said in so mournful
a tone, that the Sunflower suddenly started and
looked up. “Very sick here. Wawandah wishes
only to encounter another bear. The victory would
not be the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he uttered these words, his eyes beaming with
melancholy tenderness were turned upon the wife of
the White Bear. It was just at that moment she
looked up. Their glances met. His dark and handsome
features became flushed with crimson, as he
traced in hers he thought, pity, sorrow, and a full
understanding of his position. A thousand delicious
thoughts possessed his being. That look of commiseration
had repaid him for every insult he had
endured. To be rewarded by another, he would
have subjected himself to the same a thousand fold.
As for the Sunflower, she could not tell wherefore,
but it seemed to her as if a new light had dawned
upon her being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” said the chief, presenting his hand, “I
pity you, for I see it all. You love a squaw, who
does not love you—and that I know is enough to turn
the rifle aside, and check the speed of the race.
When the heart is sick the body is sick also. I am
old, Wawandah, but I know it—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See!” he continued, after a short pause, “there
is one who ought to be your sister. The White Bear
owes her life to you. Without your arm his wigwam
would be as a desert. Taken from the fangs
of one white bear, you have preserved her for the
arms of another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sunflower and Wawandah looked this time
fully, tenderly into each other’s eyes—a new affinity
had been created—a new tie mutually acknowledged.
It was the first time they had been made aware that
she was the young girl thus saved. They both
colored deeply, and with a consciousness that that
information was fraught with good or evil, for the
future, to themselves. Both awaited with interest
and impatience what was to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wawandah,” pursued the chief, “I feel that I
have wronged you by neglect. But I will make
amends for it. Once more you shall be a man—a
hunter—a warrior. You shall abandon your tent and
live in mine. It is large enough for us all. The
Sunflower will be glad to receive him who saved
her life in the most daring manner. Her smiles will
make you forget your hopeless love, and when her
hands have prepared the morning meal, we shall go
forth to the chase, for I, too, feel that my pretty Sunflower
too often dazzles my path with its brightness,
and keeps me from the tracks of the deer and
buffalo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the friend of my father is too good,” replied
Wawandah, with a manner changed, from despair
to life and hope, which, although unheeded by the
husband, was not lost upon his beautiful wife.
“Wawandah is thankful. He will sleep in the wigwam
of the White Bear, and gain from his goodness
new courage to his heart, and strength to his arm, and
skill to his eye. He will go forth to the chase as before.
He will forget the love of the woman he
cannot have, in the friendship of his sister—in the
child the Good Spirit allowed him to save for the
friend of his father. Wawandah will be happy, and
the White Bear will make him so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sunflower rose from the spot where she was
seated at her work, and moving in all her gracefulness
and dignity of carriage to her husband’s side,
leaned over him, and thanked him for his goodness
in permitting her to aid in soothing him to whom
she owed her life and happiness with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wawandah,” said the husband of the Sunflower,
“you may go; I wished to give ease to your heart—not
to pine away like a love-sick woman. You
live here. I am not quite old enough to be your
father, for five-and-twenty years have passed over
your head, but I shall be every thing else to you;
nor is Sunflower old enough to be your mother, but
she shall be your sister, and her laughing eye shall
make you glad. Go, then, part with your wigwam,
and let it be known throughout the tribe the White
Bear adopts you as his son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that hour Wawandah became a changed
man. He lived in the wigwam of the White Bear.
The beautiful Sunflower was ever before his eyes.
Her presence inspired, her soft eye turned in gratitude
upon him who had preserved her life, infused
animation, if not hope, into his being. He had no
other thought, no other desire than to be loved by
the Sunflower as by a sister, to be near her, to listen
to her sweet voice, to mark the expression of her
beautiful eyes, to follow the graceful movements of
her tall form—all this he enjoyed, and he was happy.
Sustained by her approval, once more the buffalo and
the elk fell beneath his unerring rifle, and his
honors graced the interior of the tent which the
Sunflower decorated with her own hands. Again
he was foremost in the race, and left his competitors
behind when darting into the swollen stream they
<a id='buff'></a>buffeted against the strong current that essayed to
check their upward progress. In the wrestling-ring
no one could equal his dexterity and strength; and
where once his foot touched the ball, no opponent
could bear from him his prize until it had reached
the desired goal. The women were often spectators
of these sports, and approved the manliness and activity
of the handsome and modest-looking Wawandah,
but none more than his newly found sister,
the peerless Sunflower of the White Bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange!” she would muse to herself, as she
saw him amidst the loud plaudits of the aged and
the young of the warriors, of the matron and of the
maid bear off every prize for which he contended—“strange,
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
that before he came to dwell within our
wigwam, he was as a child, and even now is a
strong man, proud in his own power. It was disappointed
love made him weak and uncertain of aim
in the chase, he said to the White Bear. What, then,
has made him strong, for no love warms him yet
but the love of his sister.” The Sunflower sighed;
she thought of the eloquent looks he had often cast
upon herself, and she endeavored to give a new
direction to her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often would the White Bear and Wawandah set
out on a hunting excursion of a couple of days, and
return so laden with the meat of the buffalo and the
deer, that the horses they took with them for the
purpose, could with difficulty walk under the heavy
burdens. Then would the children, seeing them
coming from a distance, clap their hands, and utter
shouts of rejoicing, until the whole encampment attracted
by their cries, would turn out and gathered
together in small groups, await the arrival of the
hunters, to whom the word and hand of greeting were
cordially given. The Sunflower would watch all
this from a distance, and in silence; and her heart
would become glad, for well she knew where the
choicest of the game killed by Wawandah’s hand
would be laid—at his sister’s feet with a look of such
touching eloquence of prayer for its acceptance that
the very anticipation took from her loneliness in absence;
and she was always right, for never on one
occasion did Wawandah fail, and when he had given
of the best to the wife of the White Bear, his soft
and beautiful eyes rendered more lustrous by the
deep hectic overspreading his brown cheek, would
thank him with such expression of silent eloquence,
that her own heart would invariably flutter, and her
own cheek flush with as deep a crimson. And then,
happy and contented and rewarded for all his toil,
Wawandah would bear the remainder of his game
to the tents of the chiefs, and distribute among the
grateful wives of these the remainder of the proceeds
of his unequalled skill. No one was now
a greater favorite throughout the Saukie camp
than the late despised Wawandah, the son of the
Black Vulture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once in the middle of August the White Bear and
Wawandah set out with two others on an excursion,
which was to last five days. Time had so accustomed
the Sunflower to the presence of her brother,
and his absence on similar occasions had so seldom
exceeded a couple of days, that when the fifth had
arrived she was uneasy and unhappy; and her longing
for Wawandah’s return became such that she
now, for the first time, became aware of the full
extent of her own feelings for him. She trembled
to admit the truth to herself, but it was in vain to
conceal it. Guilt was in her soul. She loved Wawandah.
True, but she was resolved that while she
sought not to change the character of their existing
relations, she would allow them to go no further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has already been shown that the Sunflower was
in the habit of bathing in the stream on which the
encampment of the Saukies had been pitched. This
was about a mile up, and in a secluded nook or
narrow bay, the overhanging banks of which, closely
studded with trees, formed a complete shelter from
the observation of the passing stranger. The evening
of the day previous to that on which the hunters
were expected back was exceedingly sultry, and the
Sunflower had gone with another Saukie—a daughter
of one of the chiefs—to indulge in her favorite and
refreshing bath. After disporting themselves for
some time in the running and refreshing stream,
they were preparing to resume their dress, when
both were startled by a low and sudden growl from
the top of the bank immediately above them. The
Saukie maiden looked for a moment, and then trembling
in every limb, and yet without daring to utter
a word, pointed out to the Sunflower, on whose
shoulder she leaned, two glaring eyes which, without
seeing more of the animal, they at once felt to be
those of a panther evidently fixed on themselves.
The animal gave another low growl, and by the
crashing of the underwood amid which it lay, they
knew it was about to give its final spring. Filled
with terror the Sunflower uttered a loud scream
and even as the animal sprang downward from his
lair the report of a rifle resounded, and the whizzing
ball was distinctly heard as it passed their ears. The
water around the gurgling spot where the panther
leaped into the stream, was deeply tinged with his
blood. He had been wounded, but not so severely
as to prevent him from being an object of unabated
terror. Not five seconds, however, had elapsed,
before another form came from the very spot whence
the panther had sprung. The beast, infuriated by
its wound, was running or rather bounding rapidly
toward the Sunflower, who, paralyzed at the danger,
stood incapable of motion, and standing immersed
up to her waist in the stream, and with her long
dark hair floating over its surface. With a wild and
savage cry, meant to divert his attention to himself,
Wawandah, for it was he, pursued the animal as
rapidly as he could through the interposing water.
Startled by his unexpected appearance, the Sunflower
became, for the first time, conscious of her
position, when turning, she fled as fast as she could
with a view to gain the beach and turn the ascent
to the hill. This act saved her from severe laceration,
if not death, for it afforded time for Wawandah
to overtake the monster. Seeing itself closely pursued,
the latter turned to defend itself, and before
Wawandah could seize it by the back of the neck,
with a force against which it vainly struggled, it had
severely wounded him in the left shoulder. Infuriated
with pain, and still more so at what he knew
to be the exposed position of the Sunflower, the latter,
even while the teeth of the panther were fastened in
his shoulder, drew from his side his deadly knife,
and burying it to the handle in its heart, while he
worked furiously to enlarge the wound, at length
contrived to leave it lifeless floating on the surface
of the stream. This done, his first care was the
safety of the Sunflower. He knew that while he
continued there she would not return for her clothes,
which were lying on the beach immediately under
the point from which he had, on hearing the scream,
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
leaped into the river, and therefore he had no alternative
than to call out in clear and distinct tones that
she might return without fear, as the panther was
dead and he himself about to ascend the bank on the
opposite side, to secure his rifle and await her coming,
as, after the danger she had so barely escaped,
he was determined not to allow her to be exposed,
unprotected, to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening it was made known in every part
of the Saukie encampment by the daughter of the
chief, that but for the sudden appearance and prompt
action of the brave Wawandah, both herself and the
Sunflower would have been torn to pieces by an
enormous and savage panther, whose eyes were
balls of fire, and whose teeth were like the wild
boar’s tusk. Again were the plaudits of the camp
bestowed upon him, and the head chief ordered a
war dance to be performed in honor of the exploit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dance was continued until late at night, but
Wawandah did not mix in it. Thoughts were passing
in his mind that little disposed him to join in
festivities given in honor of himself. For the first
time, that day he had seen enough of the symmetry
of form of the Sunflower to know that she could no
longer be as a mere sister to him. He felt that she
must be to him as a wife or he must die. Giving as
a reason, and it was a true one, that his arm pained
him very much, he retired to his bear-skin couch
long before the war dance had terminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sunflower sat at his side, and with a decoction
of herbs which she had boiled down to a thick gelatinous
matter, ever and anon bathed the wound, and
with a look so eloquent with thankfulness for this
second serious service which he had rendered her,
that Wawandah felt an irrepressible fire kindling in
his veins, while his eyes were absolutely riveted on
her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How came my brother so near me and so far
away from the camp,” she asked, desirous of turning
his thoughts from an admiration that pained, yet not
displeased her, “and where has he left the White
Bear and his companions. Was it well to come back
without them?” she concluded, half reproachfully,
for she began to feel the danger of her position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was well that Wawandah came,” he said,
with more animation than he had hitherto evinced.
“But listen, my sister. An elk, with horns like the
branches of a great tree, had fallen beneath my rifle,
when suddenly a panther sprang from its lair.
Determined to lay its skin at your feet, I followed it.
The chase was long; it lasted from daybreak to the
setting sun. I knew not where I was, or in what
direction I was going. Suddenly the panther crouched
in a small thicket. I heard a cry. Oh, who could
mistake the birdlike voice of my sweet sister. The
hair on the crown of my head seemed to move. I
felt my cheek white as that of a pale face—my heart
was sick. As the panther took his spring I fired.
Oh, had I been myself, I should have killed him
dead, but fear took away my skill and I was a
woman, even as I had been for many moons before,
until the sister that I loved without hope brought
comfort to my soul by smiling upon me under the
roof of her own wigwam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the Sunflower bent beneath the ardor
of his gaze,—her heaving bosom marked her emotion,
and her hands dropped mechanically at her side.
Now, for the first time, she knew that it was through
his silent love for her that the generous and noble-hearted
Wawandah had incurred the odium of his
tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” pursued the youth, “now that the panther
is dead, and the Sunflower is safe, Wawandah is
glad of the wound received in saving her. His step
had never dared to move toward the spot where
she bathed, but the Good Spirit led him, even in the
guise of a panther, to behold that which he had never
seen but in his dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused; leaning on his elbow, he had taken
the small hand of the Sunflower. He felt it tremble
beneath the slight pressure of his. Then he continued:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The love that filled my heart like the devouring
fire of the prairie, before the good White Bear
adopted me as his son, was nothing to what it is now.
The Sunflower must be Wawandah’s wife or she
must see him die. He will not live without her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had the warrior awakened such interest in
the bosom of the wife of the White Bear. His
beautiful eyes spoke a language she could not resist.
The deepening crimson of her cheek, the languor of
her eye, and the heaving of her bosom, were her
only answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Sunflower is Wawandah’s forever,”
he exclaimed, as he caught and pressed her to his
heart, and imprinted the first kiss of love upon her
brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still she replied not. She felt as if an inevitable
fate was impelling both to their destruction; but
there was sweetness in the thought. The enormity
of the ingratitude to the White Bear did not at first
occur to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must fly,” she at length murmured. “The
Sunflower is now the wife of Wawandah, and she
must seek another home. The White Bear will be
here to-morrow, and never can the guilty one he
loves bear to look upon his generous face again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Sunflower shall look upon him no more—no
more dazzle the White Bear with the glare of
her beauty,” answered the youth. “Far from this
Wawandah shall erect his tent, and alone. No one
but his wife shall know where he dwells, or share
his solitude. He has no thought but of her. While
she gladdens his sight with her presence, he will
ask no more of the Spirit of Good. The camp is
scarcely yet at rest. An hour before the dawn we
will depart; and when the sun rises its fairest flower
will have traveled far from the tent of the White
Bear forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The heart of the Sunflower is full of gladness,”
said the latter. “Never does she wish to behold the
face of another warrior but Wawandah. She loves
him because he has so long loved herself. Ah, how
much must she love him, when she leaves the tent
of the White Bear forever to fly with him. It is
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
very wicked this. The Good Spirit will punish her,
but her love for Wawandah is too great. She has
not power over herself. She would not stay if she
could. And now it is too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an hour before dawn Wawandah went stealthily
forth. All was stillness in the camp, and only here
and there was to be seen the flickering of some
expiring fire, while the low growl of the dog, too
vigilant to be quite silent, and yet too lazy to bark
outright, greeted him as he passed outside the skirt
of his encampment. Presently he arrived at an open
space or sort of oasis in the forest, where were
tethered many horses with great blocks of wood
fastened to one of the fore fetlocks. Selecting two
of the best looking and best conditioned of these, he
put bridles upon them, and removing the unwieldy
clogs, led them back to the door of the wigwam of
the White Bear. This time the dogs did not suffer
themselves to be disturbed. They seemed to recognize
the horses, and to know that he who led them
was of the tribe to the masters of which they belonged,
and that the doubt they had in the first
instance entertained no longer had existence. Leaving
the horses standing quietly at the entrance,
Wawandah went in. The Sunflower had put together
every thing that could be conveniently placed
in two bundles, and then, having thrown the rude
saddles on the horses, Wawandah now fastened one
to each crupper. The Sunflower was dressed in
leggings of blue and the moccasins she was making
when first Wawandah entered the tent. A man’s
black hat, with a white plume thrust through the
band, was upon her head, and a mantle of blue
cloth, fastened by a large silver brooch, upon her
shoulders. Her linen was white as the snow, and
altogether her great beauty was adorned with the
richest articles of her limited wardrobe, and in a
manner befitting the occasion. While Wawandah,
too, decked himself in his best and secured his faithful
weapons and companions of the chase, she cut
from the long hair she loosened for the purpose, a
large tress, which she tied near the root with a blue
ribbon, and fastened it to a nail within the wigwam
door. This was a token to the White Bear that she
still regarded even while she had deserted him for
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wawandah pressed her again fondly to his heart.
He was not jealous, but glad that the heart of the
Sunflower bled for what she knew the White Bear
would suffer at her loss. He raised her in his arms
to the saddle she had been accustomed to use.
Then carefully closing the door, and putting a stick
over the wooden latch to secure it, he vaulted into
the other. He then turned his horse, followed by the
Sunflower, in the direction of the bathing ground,
beyond which the course he intended to take lay,
and as they passed, a beam from the moon which
had then risen, glanced upon the form of the dead
panther floating nearly on the spot where he had
killed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sunflower gazed upon it with deep interest,
for she felt that to that hideous beast was to be
ascribed the eventful step which she had taken, and
which was to decide the future misery or happiness
of her life. Presently the encircling arm of Wawandah,
who had reined in her horse, influenced
by a nearly similar feeling, clasping her to his heart,
seemed to admonish her of the intensity of joy he,
too, had derived from the same cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That embrace refreshed and invigorated them.
Once more, at the gentle bidding of Wawandah, the
Sunflower put her horse into a gallop, and ere the
dawn of day the camp of the Saukies had been left
far behind.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART SECOND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the distance of fifteen miles from the encampment
of the Saukies, and on the same stream, was a
small post, belonging to the Canadian North-West
Company of that day. As was usual in that region,
it was surrounded with a stockade, as a protection
against any sudden attack of the Indians. The force
within consisted principally of voyageurs, trappers,
hunters, and, in fine, of men of such avocations as
were connected with the fur trade, then in its highest
stage of prosperity. The gentleman in charge was
a Mr. Hughes, for many years subsequently, and
even at this day, one of the British superintendents
of Indian affairs. Besides the buildings which composed
the post, there was a good deal of spare ground,
which had been alloted for the security of horses and
cattle, embraced within the picketings. Around this
place the ground was denuded of trees, and nothing
but a mass of shapeless stumps was to be seen extending
for nearly half a mile in every way, except
toward the front, which was bounded by the stream
which divides it from the woods on the opposite
bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, late at night, an Indian was seen approaching
and driving before him a number of horses,
tied by strings of bark, and so disposed as to keep up
the order of what is called the Indian file. Three
stout Canadians were sitting on a sort of elevated
platform, which served as a look-out over the stockade,
one cutting with a great clasp knife a piece of
fat pork upon his bread, that served him as a substitute
for a plate; a second puffing a cloud of
smoke from a long handled black stone pipe; and
the third lying on his back with his knees drawn up,
and singing one of those plaintive boat songs which
were peculiar to the Canadian voyageur of the commencement
of the present century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Baptiste, cease that refrain of yours and
listen,” said the man who was eating his supper of
pork, and who evidently was at that moment on duty
as look-out. “I am sure I hear the tramp of horses—and
sure enough it is them. See how they come,
in file, like a string of dried peaches. I’ll bet the
best beaver I shoot or trap to-morrow, that scoundrel
Filou, the Chippewa, has been at his old work again
and stolen a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baptiste finished his singing, as directed, jumped
to his feet, and looked in the direction in which his
companions had turned their gaze. There was a
mass of something moving, but whether men or
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
horses the night was too dark to enable him to distinguish
with accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parbleu!” said the man who was smoking, “we
had better tell the master. The Saukies are not over
friendly to us, and it may be a party of them stealing
upon us, in the hope of catching us napping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! Latour,” returned the man of the watch,
“the Saukies don’t make so much noise when they
move. It’s horses’ hoofs we hear, and not the feet
of men. A bottle of whisky to a blanket it’s Filou
with a fresh prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The odds are certainly long you give,” said Le
Marie, after he had delivered himself of a prolonged
puff; “but, sure enough, it is a gang of horses, and
that’s devilish like the Chippewa, who rides the
first and leads the remainder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All doubt was soon at rest, by the well-known
voice of the Chippewa asking for admission for himself
and horses into the stockade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comment!” said Le Marie, “do you take me
for a blancbec, to suppose I shall do any thing of the
sort? You have stolen those horses, Filou, and no
good will ever come to us if we let them in here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask captin,” said the Chippewa, in a tone
that denoted he expected his application to be made
known to that responsible officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment was a critical one. The Saukie Indians,
as has been before stated, had manifested a
hostile feeling toward the inmates of the post, and
the avoidance of offense had been strictly enjoined,
as a matter of policy, upon the people of the establishment.
Filou, more than all the others, knew
of the position and means of defense of the stockade,
and therefore it became particularly a matter of
precaution not to offend him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the rascal’s message to the chief, Baptiste,
and know if he is to be admitted or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes Captain Hughes, in no very good
humor, made his appearance at the look-out, and
seeing the large train of horses which the rascal had
stolen, told him, decidedly, that he himself might
come into the fort if he chose to leave his plunder
behind him; but that the latter must remain without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chippewa grumbled a good deal at this decision,
told him that he had lost a good horse, and
finally decided on remaining without himself and
keeping watch over the animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night passed away, and it was about an hour
before dawn when the report of a rifle was heard,
and soon afterward a second, from a greater distance.
Aroused from their slumbers, Captain Hughes and
his people instantly rose and repaired to the look-out,
where the drowsy sentinel was just awakening
from his sleep, and were accosted from without by
the Chippewa, who told them, with an alarmed air,
that the enemy were stealing upon them, and earnestly
craved admittance for himself and horses.
This request, after some little hesitation on the part
of Captain Hughes, was granted. His people were
kept on the alert during the remainder of the night,
but nothing was to be seen that could justify an
alarm. Toward morning, however, Captain Hughes
resolved to go forth with a party and reconnoitre. He
insisted that the Chippewa, who was extremely unwilling
to move, should accompany them, and point
out the direction whence the firing proceeded. In
vain he pleaded that he was tired and wanted rest.
They compelled him to lead the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until the day began to dawn, every thing was dark
in the extreme—so much so, indeed, that the undenuded
stumps which, scorched and blackened by
fire, had been left to complete their natural decay,
were scarcely visible; but as the mists of night
cleared away, the opening of the forest, about a mile
distant from the stockade, was distinctly seen, and
all eyes were turned toward it, as though to a place
of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” said Le Marie, who the next after the
Chippewa headed the party, making a sign for them
at the time to stop. “There is no enemy there,” he
said, “but one, and him I should very much like to
put a bullet into. Look! don’t you see that white
bear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole party looked attentively, and distinctly
saw the skin of a white bear, but its actions were so
erratic that none could account for the singular attitudes
into which it appeared to throw itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll soon stop his dancing,” said Le Marie, as he
raised his ride, “and if I don’t finish him, Baptiste,
you can follow my shot on the instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” said Captain Hughes, striking down the
leveled rifle; “pretty eyes for voyageurs and hunters,
you have. Don’t you see that it is only the
loose skin of a white bear, and that there is some
one waving it toward us as a signal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parbleu, so it is!” said Le Marie, doggedly, for
he was annoyed, priding himself, as he did, on his
keenness of sight as a hunter, that the captain
should have noticed his mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drew nearer, they could make out, just
within the skirt of the wood, an Indian, reclining
against a tree, and waving toward them, as a signal,
the skin of a grizzly bear. Close at his side, and
leaning her head upon her hands, was a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party approached, still headed by the Chippewa.
When they had arrived within a few yards,
the stranger Indian drew up his body, seated as he
was, to his full height, and looking indignantly at the
Chippewa, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the man who shot me. The eye of Wawandah
is good, and he can tell his enemy even in
the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is this?” asked Captain Hughes, turning to
the horse stealer. “You, then, fired the shot which
you pretended to me was that of an enemy approaching
the fort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chippewa for a moment was confused, but
soon he replied, sullenly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came to steal my horses; he had taken two
of them, and was going off when I fired. He fired
again, but his ball went into a stump at my side.
Was I right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never come near the fort again,” said Captain
Hughes, angrily, for he was interested in the condition
of the noble featured youth. “You are a black-hearted
villain. You steal horses in droves; and because
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
another deprives you of one or two, you take
his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eye of Wawandah brightened as he listened
to the words of Captain Hughes, which were, of
course, spoken in Indian. “Wah!” he exclaimed,
“I did not steal—I only exchanged horses. Those
I left were better than those I was going to take.
They were fresher than my own—I wanted them.
But,” he added, fiercely, “I am not going to die by
his hand—he shall not dance over my scalp. Sunflower,”
he asked, after a moment’s pause, “do you
love me still, now that I am going to die and leave
you without a home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep sobs came from the bosom of the unhappy
and guilty woman. She bent her head over him,
and said, gently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, should I be here did I not love you, Wawandah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” he answered, pressing her vehemently
to his heart. “It is sweet to me to hear the Sunflower
say that she loves the dying Wawandah.
The white chief will take care of you when I am
dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Wawandah dies, the Sunflower will die too.
She cannot live without him. Her heart is too full
to live alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” he replied. “The white chief will
go with you to the White Bear. He will say that I
am very sorry for the wrong I have done him, and
that the last prayer of Wawandah, who has been so
ungrateful to him, is, that he will take back his
wife—the sweetest flower of the Saukie tribe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sunflower raised her drooping head, and
looked Wawandah steadily in the face for some moments.
She made no remark, but resumed the same
desponding attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summoning all his remaining strength—for life
was fast ebbing away—the Indian now stretched
himself to the utmost tension of his body, and, shouting
out the war-cry of his tribe, drew his knife and
plunged it into his heart—then fell back and expired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some moments the Sunflower lay as one unconscious
on the bleeding body of the ill fated Wawandah;
then raising herself up, she revealed her
face, the extreme paleness of which was visible
even beneath the dark hue of her skin. She asked
the Chippewa to come near her, that she might communicate
to him a message for the White Bear, offering
her silver arm bands as the price of his service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cupidity of the Chippewa, more than any remorse
he felt, or desire to assist the Sunflower, induced
him to approach and receive the trinkets and
the message; but while he was busily engaged in
securing that which was on her left arm, the Sunflower
suddenly drew the knife from the body of her
husband and plunged it into the heart of the Chippewa,
to whom she owed all the bitterness of her fate.
He fell dead at the feet of Wawandah, and before
Captain Hughes, or any of his party, had time to
prevent her, or even to understand her intention, she
raised herself to her feet with the reeking knife in
her hand, and killed herself with a single and unfaltering
blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deeply shocked and pained by this lamentable catastrophe,
Captain Hughes caused his men to cut
litters with their axes and carry the bodies to the
fort. No one felt regret for the just punishment of
the Chippewa; but the fate of the unhappy lovers
created a deep sympathy in the hearts of all—the
more so from the surpassing personal beauty of both.
Two graves were dug—one inside and the other on
the outside of the stockade. In the first was placed
a rude coffin, lined with a buffalo skin, which Captain
Hughes had substituted for that of the grizzly
bear, were placed the bodies of Wawandah and the
Sunflower. A sort of mound was then raised over
it, and at the head was stuck a short pole, the top of
which, for about twelve inches, was painted red.
The Chippewa was thrown unceremoniously, and
without coffin, into the grave that had been dug for
him outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time afterward Captain Hughes, having occasion
to visit the encampment of the Shawnees, on
a subject connected with the differences then existing
between them and the North-West Company,
took the opportunity of communicating to the White
Bear all that he knew relating to the flight and death
of the unfortunate Sunflower and Wawandah; adding
to the detail the account of the sepulchral rites
he had caused to be accorded to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief, a good deal emaciated and of much
sterner look than when last introduced to the reader,
at first heard him with grave and imperturbable
silence. But when he came to that part of his narrative
which described the remorse of Wawandah
for the injury he had done him, a tear, vainly sought
to be hidden by a sudden motion of the head, stole
down his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will my brother smoke?” he said abruptly,
handing him his pipe, while he, with the disengaged
hand, pressed that of Captain Hughes with the utmost
cordiality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, my brother,” he said, after a pause.
“You have done well to the White Bear. His wigwam
is empty without the Sunflower, who used to
shed light upon his hearth. Joy no more can enter
it. The White Bear is alone among the rest of his
tribe, like a blasted pine in the midst of a green forest;
but it does good to his heart to hear the son of
his friend—the broken-hearted one that he took into
his lodge to soothe and to heal—was sorry that he
stole the flower of his heart, and left but a thorn in
its place. The White Bear is sorry for them both;
but they were young and foolish, and dearly have
they been punished. I forgive them, brother,”
again extending his hand, “and I love the white
chief, who did not leave their bodies to be devoured
by the wolves, but buried them as the White Bear
would have them buried. I am glad too that you
treated the Chippewa as a dog, without any sign to
mark where he lays. I feel that many moons will not
pass over me; but while they do, I will live less unhappy
at my loss, and ever love the white chief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus terminated their interview; and Captain
Hughes heard, not one month later, of the death of
the White Bear.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY ANGELE DE V. HULL.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a large, old-fashioned house, at the pleasant
country place of ——, dwelt a happy and united
family, consisting of a father and five daughters.
Through the wide, long hall merry voices were ever
heard, and round and round twinkling feet went dancing
on the pleasant gallery that ran on all sides,
that there might be nothing to stop these light-hearted
creatures in their course. Each had her neat,
sweet-looking chamber, wherein, at times, she might
retire to while away leisure hours with some cherished
book, or with rapid pen convey to paper her
pure and fresh thoughts—thoughts that were too sacred
to be spoken—that wove themselves into
dreams of delight, that were never, never to be realized.
Happy, happy days! when they could weave
these bright fancies, and dared to turn away from
reality. The past had but its pleasures—the present
its more rational yet constant enjoyment, and the
future was hid by the rose-colored cloud that floated
over its blessed anticipations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. de la Croix looked upon his daughters as his
crown of jewels, and the homestead as the humble
and unworthy casket that contained it. They were
a host within themselves to drive away dull care,
and left him by the most exemplary of wives to perpetuate
her fondly cherished memory. Dearly loved
they to dwell upon her virtues, her unfailing benevolence,
her undying love for them all, and that holy
piety that burned like a precious light throughout her
life. Sacred to them were the paths her footsteps
trod, the flowers she loved, and the trees her hand
had planted; and they strove with all their might of
youth and inexperience to supply her place to the
husband she had loved and taught them to love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you all—Blanche, Lisa, Kate, Rose
and Minnie,” cried Mr. de la Croix, one morning,
coming out of his room. “Who is ready to sew on
a button for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, papa,” “and I,” answered the five, hurrying
on their dressing-gowns and opening their doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am first,” said Rose, coming forward with
her thimble and needle. “Go back, every one of
you!” and she pushed them playfully away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what a shame that papa has to call us up
for such a thing. Minnie, this is your week—naughty
girl! and you must be scolded for negligence,”
said Lisa, shaking her dignified head at the
culprit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie ran behind her father, peeped into his face
as she poked hers under his arm, and raised her
saucy eyes to his. She was the youngest, and consequently
a privileged imp, depending upon every
one else to mend and darn when her turn came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away, you wild girl,” said her father, smiling.
“Rose is the most industrious of you all, for she is
dressed before any of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rose is housekeeper, and had to be up, papa;
don’t inflate her with praise she does not deserve. I
have been up an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An hour! and what were you doing, Miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je flanais</span>—there’s French for you, in good
earnest; and I heard the first bird that sang this morning,”
answered Minnie, with a gay laugh. “I was
making reflections of the most profound nature when
you disturbed me—and thus the world has lost a lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I have been reading La Bruyère before my
dressing glass,” said Blanche, complacently, as soon
as the mirth that followed Minnie’s speech had subsided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have been at work already,” added Lisa,
as she drew herself up. Lisa was the tall one, and
had the air of a princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lisa! <span class='it'>you</span> remind one of the old lady who
sat in her rocking chair and did nothing,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>‘From morning till night,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;But darn, darn, darn;’”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and Kate’s merry black eyes danced about from one
to the other. “Now, <span class='it'>I</span> have been writing verses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, be an authoress—scribbler, and have a
mania for dirt, disorder and ink-stands. Pshaw!
look at your fingers,” said Lisa, pointing to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wash them—I’ll wash them!” cried Kate,
“without mumbling over ugly spots, like Lady Macbeth.
My little nail brush will do more than all her
perfumes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And running to her room she went to work to verify
her word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they all met at breakfast, and Lisa presided
at the cheerful board, like the mother bird, while the
rest chatted around her. She was not the eldest but
the most thoughtful, and to her all came for assistance
and advice. Her long fingers could fashion
dresses, collars, ruffs, bonnets, if necessary, and her
ingenuity trampled upon impossibilities with every
new pattern that appeared. So, while Blanche busied
her fine head with metaphysics, piano, harp and
guitar, the three others learned from both to be agreeable
and useful members of society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Society they cared little for. Blanche had been
a belle par excellence until she became tired and disgusted
with admiration and lovers, whose name was
legion. Lisa never liked one or the other. She contemplated
balls and beaux at a distance, and called
them absurdities, though nothing pleased her like
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
dressing her sister, and seeing her courted and
flattered, night after night and day after day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Kate, she had a touch of the romantic; she
liked to sing and dance at home, loved to laugh and
be merry with those of her own age, but thought
that home the fairest and best place in the world. So,
after a winter of dissipation, she foreswore the beaumonde,
and vowed its votaries a heartless set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose’s large, soft, dark eyes never wandered farther
than the fences that bounded her father’s enclosures.
With something of eccentricity she loved to
steal off and enjoy a lonely hour at the close of each
day, and her piety became a proverb. Nothing
could move her out of the reach of the household
gods, and at eighteen she was a child at heart and
in manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie was the imp! Minnie loved the world,
and longed for a debut, as the minor “pants for
twenty-one.” For her all hands must work—for
her all hands must stop; and thus they were all at
home, a bird’s nest of different nestlings, ready to
take wing and fly when the parent bird has ceased
to control their movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, daughters, sing and play,” said Mr. de la
Croix, as he sat in his arm chair, at the wide hall
door. “What are you all about, eternally sewing
and reading? Give the old house some life, will
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche rose and seated herself at the piano, running
her little white hands skillfully over the keys.
Kate pulled the harp out of the corner, and soon a
loud, clear voice swelled melodiously through the
air. Then came a chorus of fresh young notes, and the
soft strains of the piano, with the harp’s wild, sweeping
music, mingled together, while the father sat
listening to his crown of jewels, full of rapture and
pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give us that trio in Guillaume Tell, sister,” said
Rose, when they had finished, and little Minnie
glided into Blanche’s seat, while the three grouped
around her to comply. Then the chairs were drawn
together, and the five tongues rattled like magpies to
the half bewildered Mr. de la Croix, until he called
for his candle and went to his apartment, followed
by Kate, singing,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie!” said Lisa, holding up a dress with a
wide rent in it, “is it ‘the weakness of my eyes
that shapes this monstrous apparition,’ or is it a reality?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now!” cried the girl, snatching the dress
from her, “you are on one of your poking expeditions.
I didn’t intend you should see this, sister
Lisa, for Rose promised to mend it for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And has Rose nothing to do for herself, that she
is to waste time on your carelessness?” returned
Lisa, gravely. “It is not two weeks since we made
this for you, and now it is ruined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it to me,” said Rose, quietly; “I did promise
to mend it, and would have done so before, but
had the house to attend to; and the keeping it and
providing for it is any thing but a sinecure. Get me
a piece out of the scrap basket, Minnie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the way you all combine to spoil Minnie,”
said Blanche, raising her head from her book.
“She will never be fit for any thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay!” said the other, with an arch look and
pointing to the volume, now closed, “and who
makes pretty things for Miss Blanche, while she sits
in her room poring over dull maxims and writing
them off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how am I to teach you if I do not learn
something myself?” asked Blanche, with a serious
expression on her fair souvenir-like face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t teach me any of your old cynic Rochefoucauld’s
scandal. I hate him, for he never says a
good thing of the human heart, and places my own
motives so often before my eyes that I take him for
a reflector of my inward-self, and blush.” And Minnie
covered her face in mock confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better, then,” said Rose; “for St.
Paul tells us to know ourselves, and I vote that we
treat you to a double dose of ‘les maximes’ every
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Daniel come?” said Minnie, bending low and
performing a salaam before her sister, who was
seized with a fit of laughter that prevented her replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that you will keep your absurd ideas to
yourself, Minnie,” observed Lisa, who now began
to rip away at the torn skirt. “You are talking
treason when you begin to abuse La Rochefoucauld.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Treason or no treason, then,” cried she springing
out of her seat, “the whole world may come
and listen to me, if my head were the penalty. So,
I am off to the library. No, I wont go there, either,
lest the old gentleman’s ghost jump at me; but I’ll
go and practice the ‘Bamboula,’ and sister Blanche
may dance a Congo polka to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister Blanche leaves polkas to giddy girls, but
is, nevertheless, delighted to hear them speak of
practicing. You were as lazy as a sloth over
that ‘Sueia’ of Strakosch’s, and do not know it
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! <span class='it'>ça viendra</span>, as papa says when you
all talk gravely over Rose and me. I am a perfect
pattern of industry with regard to my music, am I
not, Lisa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly do pummel away unmercifully at
the poor piano,” said Lisa; “but half the practicing
consists of imitations of Mrs. this, or Miss that, in
style, position or banging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t people go about and give imitations
of different lions? I’m sure I only endeavor to
carve out a distinguished name for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious?” quoted
Lisa, turning with a smile from the willful thing
that would never hear reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, what fame is to arise from your imitation
of Mr. Gamut’s elbows? Or from Lucy Grey’s
symphonies?” asked Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate! Kate! did you not laugh yesterday when
I played for you until the tears rolled down your
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
face? And didn’t you vow that Mr. Gamut himself
sat at the piano?” said Minnie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I did. More shame for me!” exclaimed
Kate, laughing anew. “But your imitations, as
you call them, are more than human risibilities
could resist. I call Rose to witness in this case!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t call me to witness any more of Minnie’s
pranks,” said Rose. “I cannot encourage them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll force you, then,” cried Minnie, seizing
Kate around the waist. “Now look at Mr. and
Mrs. Dobbs waltz together.” And round she spun,
pulling Kate after her, until Lisa and Blanche were
adding their peals of laughter to Rose’s hearty
amusement. Away they went until Minnie whirled
her sister out of the room, and soon after sat down
to the Bamboula in sober earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended all attempts at controlling Minnie, and
her task seemed that of creating merriment wherever
she went and turning all reproof into a mockery.
Indeed, she laughed too constantly, and there were
times when Lisa shook her head gravely at this
perpetual merriment. A woman’s duties begin so
sternly and so positively from the hour she marries—the
bridal wreath so quickly withers into one of
cares and fears, that the sight of a creature like
Minnie, full of thoughtlessness and glee, saddened
the heart that knew something of them all; and poor
Lisa, with her responsibilities, vainly warned her
young sister to laugh less and reflect more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish that you were married, Blanche,” said
she one day, as they sat together. “We see so few
strangers at home, and seem so much like equals,
that Minnie will fly into the face of every thing and
every body without ever being curbed into tranquillity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what good would my marrying do, in the
name of wonder?” said Blanche with a stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A vast deal, particularly if you were to bestow
yourself upon a man like Mr. Stuart, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lisa went on with her work, and the deep blush
that suffused her sister’s fair face was unperceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lisa!” said Blanche, after a pause, and her
voice faltered; “Lisa! would you wish me marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless you are confident of being happy,
dear Blanche,” was her reply, and she looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the bright color mounted over the
cheeks of her companion, and the tears stood in her
eyes. She held out her hand, and Lisa pressed it
affectionately as she remarked her unusual emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear sister! what is it that affects you
thus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, Lisa—I <span class='it'>have</span> had thoughts of marrying,
not for Minnie’s sake—but—for my own.” She
covered her face and burst into tears. Lisa rose and
clasped her in her arms, soothing her with pet names
and kind words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Blanche—sweet dove! tell me all about it?
Is it really so? and have you promised—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have promised nothing, Lisa,” replied Blanche,
raising her head and leading her to a <span class='it'>causeuse</span>. “Sit
down; and now that I can speak, listen and advise
me.” Lisa obeyed, and turned her earnest sympathizing
eyes upon her sister with a look that invited
confidence, such as Blanche was about to give,—a
pure and unrestrained avowal of her feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, Lisa, that I met Mr. Stuart frequently
at my aunt’s last winter. He is a great favorite with
her, and the only one among her young men acquaintances
whose actual intimacy she solicits.
Whenever he came we were left together, naturally
enough, while my aunt and uncle busied themselves,
one with her housekeeping and the other with his
papers. There was always a congeniality of tastes
between us that led to an absence of any thing like
ceremony, and something like confidence arose in
our intercourse. There were books discussed that
both had read, and many that I had never seen,
which I was to like because he did. Wherever we
went in the evenings he went. He was always
there to draw my arm through his, and offer me the
conventional attentions that became so delightful at
length. We never spoke of love, Lisa; we never
talked sentiment <span class='it'>at</span> one another, but it was impossible
to deny that—that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You loved one another,” said Lisa, seriously.
She put on no arch looks, affected no jests—this was
a grave subject to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we never said so, Lisa,” said Blanche,
quickly. “We never said so; it was enough for us
to be together. One morning I received a note from
Helen Clarke, begging me go to her as she was very
ill. My aunt’s carriage took me to Evergreen, and
I remained a week absent. On my return I found
that <span class='it'>he</span> had been summoned to his mother’s dying
bed, and had hurried off an hour after the letter came,
taking time only to see my aunt and bid her adieu.
‘He asked earnestly after you, Blanche,’ said she,
smiling; ‘and your absence grieved him deeply,
my love. But he left a message expressive of it
all, and ended it with, Tell her, my dear Mrs. Bliss,
that I will return as soon as I can, and she must not
forget me.’ I could not forget him, Lisa; but I despise
a love-sick girl as I do the plague; so I came
home, determined to be happy again among you all.
I would have been ungrateful, indeed, to mope at
home where we all love one another—to pine for a
stranger, while I had still all that made life so dear.
Of course, he never wrote to me—my aunt heard
occasionally from him, and the letter announcing his
return, affected me deeply. Would he still be the
same, or was there a change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there was none,” said Lisa, in a low voice.
“I know that now, Blanche, though I did not dream
of this before. Blind creature that I was, not to
have felt that we must part after all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have read in his looks that there is no change,
Lisa,” said her sister, growing pale. “I know that
he will tell me so this very day, for he begged me to
remain at home this evening to see him. But, Lisa,
if you do not like him—if it grieves you too much to
have me give up my home for his, say so at once,
and I will never leave you.” Her lips quivered and
her hand shook, but the voice was steady, and she
looked at Lisa with her calm, clear eyes until she
felt those fond arms once more thrown around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, generous Blanche!” murmured the sister;
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
“did you think I could be so selfish? Love on, dear
girl, and be happy; God knows you deserve it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And soon after there was a wedding and a departure.
Forth from the bird’s-nest went the first fledgling,
and the rest sorrowed at home until Time with
its kind hand closed the wound at their hearts.
There were gleams of sunshine in the sweet, fond
letters that came with their tales of happiness and
renewed assurances that Blanche loved her old
homestead better than ever; with playful threats of
jealousy from Kenneth himself, as he added his postscript
now to one, and now to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were a long time gone, but all was repaid
when Blanche returned and placed her first born in
his grandsire’s arms. Poor baby! he was well-nigh
crushed to death as the four aunts flew at him,
but he grew used to the danger in time, and thus
spared his mother a world of nursing and petting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible not to love Kenneth Stuart—impossible
not to admire him. He had all that
high integrity, that unflinching honesty that a
woman loves to lean on. Nothing could be more
gentle in manner or more firm in purpose. He could
be grave or gay whenever he was called upon; and
his affection for his wife made him court that of her
family that he might further minister to her happiness,
so they all learned to love as well as reverence
him, calling on him for advice or sympathy as on
one another. He had none of that childish jealousy
of their mutual fondness—none of that selfish longing
to have her forget old ties for him. It pleased
him to see that same unrestrained intercourse pervade
their family meetings, to know that he had not stepped
in to shadow the light of “days gone by;” and
thus they dared once more to boast of their sunny
hours and eternal spring. Mr. de la Croix sat in
the old arm-chair, and listened to the pleasant voices
of his children as of yore. Lisa went about her
household duties with a firmer tread, Rose went
from one to the other with her gentle cares, Kate
flitted here and there, her merry eyes wandering
around to read the wants of each and all, while
Minnie skipped about and played tricks as usual, as
incorrigible as ever, in spite of Blanche’s matronly
admonitions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Ken, may I have the dark-haired, dark-eyed
cousin that Blanche talks so much about?”
said she, seating herself at his feet. “I am thinking
very seriously of the married state. I look at you and
sister and conjugate the verb, <span class='it'>j’aime</span>, <span class='it'>tu aimes</span>, <span class='it'>nous
<a id='aim'></a>aimons</span>, <span class='it'>etc.</span> I walk about with little Ernest, and
practice baby songs, besides helping Lisa to fuss
about house, and darned a most unnatural and unfatherly
hole in papa’s socks this morning. I am
perfectly recommendable, I assure you,” and she
turned up her saucy face and looked at him with
an attempt at gravity that was, as Kate said, “too
absurd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young ladies of fourteen must not think of marriage,”
replied Kenneth, with one of his peculiar
smiles. “I have destined Paul to Kate, as Lisa and
Rose eschew yokes, etc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Kate!” exclaimed Minnie, with a pout.
“And am I to be sacrificed because I am fourteen?
Unhappy me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t rave, Minnie,” cried Kate, with a gay
laugh. “I’ll resign in your favor if you say so.
My time has not come yet, nor my hero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he <span class='it'>may</span> come with this Louis le Desire,
Kate, and in spite of your Arcadian dreams of shepherds
and piping swains, you may succumb,” said
Minnie, shaking her little hand at her sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I lived to be told this?” cried Kate. “Of
all people in the world, do <span class='it'>I</span> love piping swains?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure you do, or you wouldn’t admire all
those little china monsters under green trees and
reclining on rocks that Miss Bobson crowds upon
her tables. I’ve seen you gaze at them with an
eye of love and inspiration, ten minutes at a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to keep serious while you sympathized
with her about the tarnished officer that hangs over
the mantle-piece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unnatural girl!” cried Minnie. “Is it possible
that you laugh at the sorrows of others? While I
listen with ready tears to the account of his loss at
sea, you are making light of this sacred wo. You
shall never deceive Miss Bobson again, Kate, for
I shall warn her against the deceit of young ladies
who have a passion for her porcelain, and draw
her in a retired place the very next time she unbosoms
the locket containing curls of ancient hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie! Minnie!” cried Blanche, reproachfully,
“is nothing sacred to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing about Miss Bobson, of course,” was the
reply of the heedless girl. “Do you wish to impose
on me to pity her mawkishness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To pity her age, Minnie, and her loneliness, if
nothing else,” said Kenneth, gravely. “And also
to <span class='it'>respect</span> her years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy on me! what have I done? Laughed at
a ridiculous old maid, and drawn Kate into the snare.
This is a mountain and a mole-hill, indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, leave her out then, Minnie,” said Blanche,
“and let us reprove you a little for laughing at everybody
and every thing. I heard you this morning
crying like Mrs. Simms, and you are too old now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too old!” cried Minnie, passionately. “Would
to God that I might remain a child then, if I am to
cease laughing as I grow older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laugh as long as you can, dear girl, but not so
much at others. I want you to think more, Minnie;
the world is not a paradise, and you must grow more
reasonable to bear a further knowledge of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! you have all thought for me until now,
continue to do so until I get Paul, the expected, to
do it forever. Come, Rose, for a race down the
avenue in this lovely moonlight. I want some animation
after these severe lectures.” And off they
ran together, while the rest shook their heads in
concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is too volatile,” said Kenneth, gently, “but
she will be tamed down in time. You must not
scold her for venialities like Miss Bobson again.
Now please, dear Lisa, spoil me a little and get my
candle, for I must write a letter to this very Cousin
Paul of mine, before I sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
And Paul Linden came. He was, as Blanche said,
a handsome fellow, with dark eyes, and hair like
the raven’s wing, a beautiful mouth and teeth, and
the finest whiskers in the world. He was a frank,
open, generous-hearted creature, full of kindly impulses,
but impetuous and excitable, and much beloved
by Mr. and Mrs. Stuart. This visit was one
they had long wished for, as more than probably it was
preparatory to his permanent settlement near them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible not to feel flattered at the welcome
extended him on his arrival at Mr. de la
Croix’s, and before night, he was as much at home
as though he had known them for years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am bewildered with this paradise of houris,
Kenneth,” said he, as they paced the long piazza.
“Since my poor mother’s death, which took place,
as you know, before I left college, I have never felt
so completely domesticated among women, and the
charm their society affords me is perfectly indescribable.
How happy you are to have so pleasant
a home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy, indeed, Paul! They are a lovely group,
and I consider myself peculiarly fortunate in being
able to keep my Blanche here and preserve it entire.
It would be a shame to break it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanche is a jewel in herself,” said Paul, affectionately.
“I had no idea that there could be four
more like her. What a lovely girl her sister Kate
is! I think she is <span class='it'>my</span> favorite, Kenneth, if I may
have one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Kenneth thought the preference reciprocal,
but kept his counsel until a better time, for Minnie’s
voice was heard in the hall singing to the baby, and
he smiled as he remembered how she pretended to
practice nursery songs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well done, Minnie,” said he, as they paused
at the door, and watched her graceful frolicks with
Ernest. “You are really growing quite recommendable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, brother Kenneth, if you do tell that!”
cried she, blushing, “I never will speak to you
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not tell, then,” was the reply; “but in
return for my discretion, you must go and ask Kate
if she sewed the tassel on my smoking-cap as she
promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I did,” said a pleasant voice, and
Kate, tripping out of the parlor with the cap in hand,
looked prettier than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, thank you, dear Kate! now do keep Paul in
a good humor while I go off to smoke my cigar. It
would be ill-mannered to leave him alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate smiled, and the walk on the piazza was
changed for one down the avenue. It must have
been a pleasant one, for the bell rang for tea, and
they were still there watching the pale moon rise, and
wondering within themselves how often they would
enjoy the same exercise with the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not wonder long. Every evening there
was a challenge from Paul Linden to some one, for
a walk, and somehow or other they were all tired
but Kate, and all too busy but Kate. It was not
very long, then, before the silent leaves were witnesses
to a plighting of faith between those two, and
heard (if leaves <span class='it'>can</span> hear,) what Paul Linden thought,
the softest music on earth—the low tones that told
him the loss of sweet Kate de la Croix’s heart of
hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaves saw a strange ring glitter on her fair
hand, and they were discreet—but not so the sisters.
Minnie spied the little symbol of their united faith,
and poor Kate told her secret amid tears and sobs.
Even <span class='it'>she</span> was unhappy that night, as she remembered
the burst of grief that followed its disclosure,
and another bird went from the nest almost as soon
as the wedding was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. de la Croix smoked an unusual number of
cigars the evening his daughter left, and the sisters
tried to be cheerful; but there was not one that went
to bed that night without going into Kate’s empty
room to weep afresh. Lisa had to threaten to turn
it into a rag-chamber before they could accustom
themselves to pass it without entering and mourning
its occupant as one never to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be forever crying over Kate,” she would
say; “she is coming back, and you had better wait
till then and be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we miss her so, Lisa,” said Rose, as her
large eyes filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I, but you do not see me going about crying
over an old glove or a scrap of writing as you
do. And you cannot say that I love her less than
the rest of her sisters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moreover, my dear girls,” said Kenneth, taking
his seat among them, and lifting little Ernest on his
knee, “your spirits affect your father’s. He feels the
loss of his child, and you must all try to speak of her
return and not of her departure. I know how much
you feel Kate’s absence, but you must begin to look
upon your separation as a thing that is to come one day.
It is in the course of nature. There are three more to
leave their home; how can you expect that all can be as
fortunate as Blanche and Kate, who remain with
you, as of yore. Paul’s business will probably detain
him a year, but he will return to settle here with us,
and we must look at the bright side of things as long
as we can. I have been saying all this to Blanche who
ought to be as reasonable as Lisa; and now I am
come to beg you for your own sakes to bear inevitable
trials with the fortitude that is so precious
when you once attain it. Minnie wants scolding, I
am afraid,” continued he, as he stroked her head
fondly. “Why do you not play on the piano and
sing as usual? The sound of music will enliven us
all, and the mechanical exercise of those little fingers
will occupy your mind after a while, particularly if
you set to work with those <span class='it'>études</span> of Moschelles, of
whose difficulty I have heard so much.” And he
smiled so encouragingly that Minnie flew off to
mind him, and soon after Mr. de la Croix come out
of his room, saying he was glad to hear the piano
going again. Minnie was rewarded fully when she
saw him take his old seat and doze while she played;
and she told Kenneth in confidence, that she was
much obliged to him for the scolding, but he must
not tell Lisa, because she might take advantage of
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
it. And there came that night a long letter from
Kate, that helped to comfort them all. Poor Kate!
her return was destined to be a sad one, for on the
route, her beautiful little girl, her darling Blanche, was
taken sick, and drooped so rapidly, that when she
reached home, there was no longer any hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently they folded her in their arms, and noiselessly
they bent their steps to her own old room, and
placed the little sufferer upon its bed. Its soft eyes
turned lovingly to its stricken mother, who sat beside
it in mute agony, as once more they all stood
together and mourned over her. Poor, wretched
mother! so young to be so sorrowed! How full of
anguish was the appealing look she cast upon her
father, as he gazed with all a parent’s suffering upon
his bright, merry-hearted Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that human skill could do was done—all that
tender watchfulness could effect; but the angels had
gathered round, and were beckoning that little spirit
away. Paler grew the pale cheek—dim the sweet,
loving eyes; and the young mother bent over her
beautiful child, in misery such as they know only
who have laid these treasures in the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh God of heaven!” was her mournful cry,
“thou hast taken the sunshine of my life! Darker
and darker grows the world to me, as those loved
eyes grow dim. Thou hast crushed me to the earth,
oh God! raise me with faith in thy unerring wisdom,
that I may not doubt thy justice! Oh, my treasured
one! Oh, my more than life—what is life to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband turned and placed his hand in hers.
She bowed her head upon it, as though to seek forgiveness,
and once more raised it to look upon her
darling. To the last those eyes had turned to her
with a long, lingering look, but now Lisa was closing
them in their eternal sleep, and the angels were
bearing that pure, sinless one in triumph to their
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a loud, piercing cry, the childless mother
fell back, and the sisters no longer restraining their
grief, filled the house with their cries. Kenneth bore
her out of the room, and returned for Paul, who stood
gazing at his dead infant as one stupefied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to your wife, Paul,” said he; “go to poor
Kate; your love alone can soften this heavy blow;”
and he remained to bend and kiss the now stiffening
form of the lovely little creature. “I will send
Blanche to you, Lisa; you must not perform the last
sad task alone. Alas! poor Kate! how my heart
bleeds for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then sought Mr. de la Croix, who was wildly
walking about the garden, muttering to himself in
his grief for the grandchild he had never known, and
the mother—his darling Kate. Kenneth remained
to soothe him, and after persuading him to take some
rest, returned to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little corpse was already in its grave-clothes,
looking like sculptured marble as it lay extended on
the couch. The long, shining hair was parted on
the pure brow, and fell around its head like a shower
of gold. Pale tea-roses were on its breast, and in
those white, clasped hands, emblems of its purity
and fragility. Lisa and Blanche were weeping
silently over their lost pet, and Minnie’s screams,
mingled with the more subdued cries of Rose, came
mournfully through the air. This was the first
sorrow of their womanhood, and the old homestead
seemed desolate indeed, now that the iron had
entered one young, fresh heart with its bleeding
wound, its horrid void.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate came again to look upon her child. With
Paul’s arm around her, she stood once more beside
its still cold form. Raising her hands, she uttered a
low moan that pierced the hearts of those around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, blessed babe!—my darling, my loved one!
I see you for the last time! You that I have borne,
that I have watched and cherished with more than a
mother’s care; you that have given me so much happiness,
so much pride; here is all that is left to me,
and <span class='it'>that</span> must go into the cold earth to be seen no
more! Those little arms that were folded around my
neck; those little hands that clasped mine so lovingly,
are mine no more! Those lips that never refused to
kiss me, will meet mine no more! Oh God, no
more! Why, ah why was I thus smitten to the dust?
Why was she so surely mine—so tended and so
watched? Why is she torn from the mother that
idolized her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That she might be spared your trials, my dear
child,” said a voice; and they all made room, as a
venerable-looking old man came and stood beside
her. “That she might wear that crown of glory
which even your care could not give her, and which
she now treasures as you treasured <span class='it'>her</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate bowed her head and wept. In her grief she
could not remember this, and she listened in silence
as holy words were spoken to her, and promises held
out that she might grow strong in faith. Her piety
came to her as a blessing, and she leaned, poor,
broken reed, upon the cross her Saviour bore, until
her spirit, fainting from its weight of wo, could bear
to look upward and say, “His will be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loved and the cherished was laid in her last
resting-place, and her mother left to mourn and miss
the care of her life. Affection and sympathy were
given her, and no one seemed ever impatient with
her constant grief. But she made an effort to be
cheerful once more, and mingling in the usual pursuits
of the family, found it easier than she had expected.
Her husband’s unvarying gentleness, his
watchful kindness were sources of much comfort to
her bruised spirit, and she strove, poor, grieved one!
to struggle <span class='it'>with</span> her grief. Time passed, though the
wound was fresh and often bled, Kate had learned,
for the sake of others, to appear happy and composed
because she prayed for strength. But who could
tell the fierce strife that was working in her heart?
Who could dream of the hours passed in silent suffering,
when sleep refused to visit her alone of that
quiet crowd? When through the darkness she
gazed, her spirit beckoning back the child, whose
every look was treasured, whose very cry came upon
her troubled soul; when she tortured herself into the
conviction that it might have been saved; that she
herself, poor, devoted creature, had not been the
watchful nurse beside its sick bed. Oh! if these
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
bitter thoughts <span class='it'>are</span> sent us as temptations—as trials
of our faith in the mercy and justice of the Almighty,
how often we are tried, how often in danger of
falling!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Kate struggled with a mighty strength against
these terrible remembrances, going on as usual with
her daily occupations, missing at each moment the
beloved object of her care, but walking boldly on,
not daring to look behind, lest her courage should
fail her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus she toiled and received her reward, as
days went by, and she was able to look to Heaven
alone as the haven for all who were wrecked upon
the world’s wild coast. All seemed grateful to her
for her resignation—all were kind and considerate;
and she remembered that there was between herself
and that “better land” a powerful link that nothing
could destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think that Rose is looking well, father,”
said she one day, as she went into his room with
her work, and seated herself at his side. “I wish
you would observe her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. de la Croix laid down his book with a look of
alarm. Was another one of his crown of jewels to
lose its brightness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not say that she is positively ill,” said Kate,
“but there is a languor about her—an indifference
to her usual enjoyments that I do not like. She requires
change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what can be the matter with her, my dear
child?” said her father, looking bewildered. “There
must be a cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cause that she is not probably aware of herself,
but we cannot hope that Rose’s health will
continue forever in the same perfect state, and as
her disposition is different from the rest of us, her
life has been a more sedentary one through that very
difference. You know she rarely if ever goes out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, very true, my dear, I am glad you reminded
me of this. Rose must have a change, and,
strange to tell, this very day I received a letter from
your Aunt Bliss, begging that I would let her have
one of the girls this summer to accompany her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she goes to Europe, father!” exclaimed
Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is the very thing for Rose, hard as it is
to send her so far; but it will improve her in every
thing. Send her here, my love, and tell Lisa to
come with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What surprised them all was Rose’s willingness
to go; and they all agreed that she felt the necessity
of being roused from her unusual state, to be thrown
more on her own resources. Kate’s clear judgment
had found out the evil, and proposed the remedy;
and Rose’s eyes filled as she thought of her sister’s
watchfulness in the midst of her grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preparations for her departure were of great
assistance to Kate, who busied herself diligently,
and gave herself no time for thought. She accompanied
her father and Rose to meet her Aunt Bliss,
and as the steamer was detained a few days, remained
to see her off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a sad parting, for Rose had never been
from home before; but she, timid bird, must try her
wings like the rest, and though her flight was <a id='long'></a>long,
it would be a happy one; and when Kate and her
father reached home, part of the sisters’ grief for
Rose was lost in the delight of seeing her look so
well—so much more like her former self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old homestead resumed its quiet tone, and its
occupants their usual habits, more reconciled to
their changes, more fit to play their part in the battle
of life. No longer looking upon their hoard of bliss
as secure, no longer expecting</p>

<p class='noindent'>they endeavor to prepare themselves to breast the
storm, should sorrow come again upon the little
band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All but Minnie, her grief was violent and willful,
refusing all comfort, rejecting the means of softening
it while it lasted; but there was no change in her
light volatile disposition; and Kate, poor Kate! wise
from sad experience, lectured in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Blanche?” said Lisa, coming in from
the garden with her bonnet on. “Do you know
Minnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I know? Yes; she’s hid in the moon, if you
can’t find her; for that is where Ariosto says every
thing is hid that is lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw, Minnie! do not be foolish. Where is
Blanche?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what you want with her, and I will
take a broomstick and ride after her then?” said the
wild girl. “I must be paid for so much trouble before
I undertake it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would you could promise to stay in the clouds
a while and freeze your spirits into reason. But my
wants are no secret or I’d never tell you, madcap
Minnie. Go and find Blanche, and ask her for the
key of the silver closet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is all! I’m sorry I promised now, as
the contempt I feel for the errand makes it disgraceful.
But here I go, being honor itself about keeping
promises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excepting those you make to become better and
wiser,” rejoined Lisa, as she ran off. In an instant
she was back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord bless us! She is in the library listening to
Kenneth read Cosmos. I wish he’d put <span class='it'>me</span> to sleep
sometimes, as I am sure he often does his wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish he would!” said Lisa, “and he would
oblige others besides myself. Go and ask Kate to
come down in the store-room and help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you want with Kate in the store-room,
Miss Lisa?” said Minnie, as she tied the key
she held to the string of her bonnet. “There must
be something going on that I cannot guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want her to make an Italian cream for dinner,
while I busy myself with something else that does
not concern you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the principle of ‘<span class='it'>Faut être deux pour avoir
du plaisir</span>,’ I presume,” said Minnie. “How affecting!
But something is in the wind, Lisa, or you
would not fuss over creams, etc. Is any one expected
to dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
“I give you permission to expect as many persons
as you like,” replied she, with provoking gravity.
“Tell me their names, and I will prepare the banquet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw such a mysterious old oracle as you
are! Getting out more plate, more napkins, and steeping
gelatin with so much solemnity, as though we
never did have company in our lives before, then preserving
such a dark cloud of silence on the subject!
Kate! who is coming here to-day—tell me, and don’t
be foolish about it?” cried Minnie. “Sister is enveloped
in mystery and wont let me know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate does not know herself,” said Lisa, smiling;
“but may be she can guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Rose’s birth-day,” said Kate, after a
pause, “and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I forgot it!” exclaimed Minnie, as she burst
into a flood of tears. “The first one she ever passed
away from home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the last, I trust,” said Kate, tenderly.
“Poor, dear Rose! I wonder where she is now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enjoying herself very much, I suppose,” said
Lisa, crushing a lump of sugar into her bowl of eggs,
“and wishing we were all with her. She would be surprised
at the idea of your crying about her, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie made a step forward, and threw down a
cup that was too delicate for such rough usage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” said her sister, “you have your day’s
work before you. I never saw such a careless girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said Minnie, collecting the fragments,
and smiling through her tears, “this will do
to place among</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>that <span class='it'>you</span> keep on the shelf there. I’ll cement it
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you! I wish you could mend some of
your bad habits as easily as you promise to patch
broken china. It would keep you busy for life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, poor Minnie!” said the girl, “how unjust
the world is! What can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and see that Sampson puts the dining-room
in extra trim, and fill the finger-bowls,” said Lisa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear sister! I am not Dalilah, and cannot manage
the strong hero of antiquity,” said Minnie, with
affected humility. “But I will crown the bowls with
orange leaves, and perform any other lowly task
with much pleasure.” And she left the room singing
a light song, that ever and anon fell sweetly on the
ears of that united household as they paused to catch
the tones of the young, rich voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Selby and his nephew dine with us,” said
Lisa, as she and Kate compounded their dessert
together, “and as the latter is about to sail for
Europe, papa has promised him letters for Uncle
Bliss and Rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!” said Kate. “That will be very pleasant
for them to see any one that can give such direct
news of us. Do you remember to have seen young
Mr. Selby, Lisa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he was a little boy, I saw him once at his
uncle’s, but he has been at college for years past.
He is now on a farewell visit, and will not return
for some time, of course. I hope he will be like old
Mr. Selby, for he is one of the kindest and most
agreeable men I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he is universally beloved. Paul esteems
him highly, and often goes to him for advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Kate thought Paul’s opinion sufficient to determine
the importance of the universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie had her own ideas, and very soon found
herself in merry conversation with Harry Selby, who
devoted himself to his pretty neighbor at dinner with
a zeal that made his uncle laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that, Miss Minnie? What did you say
then?” asked he across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wondering, sir, if Mr. Selby will return a
true hearted American, after seeing all the splendor
and beauty of the old world,” replied Minnie, glancing
at him with her bright eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he will,” said the uncle. “Do you
think now that any of the English blondes, the French
brunettes, or the Italian signoras, will ever drive
your saucy face out of his mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie blushed—so did Harry; but she parried
the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he can easily forget <span class='it'>me</span>, for this is our first
meeting, and will be the last; but there must be many
persons whom he could not under any circumstances
so wrong—yourself, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Selby laughed. “And so you think that my
ugly phiz will be the one to haunt a young fellow on
his travels. Do him justice, Minnie, and give him
credit for a dash of sentiment at least. Do you think
him insensible to the charm of dark eyes and
all that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By no means, sir; but it would be impertinent on
so short an acquaintance to attempt to fathom so mysterious
a thing as a human heart, such as I suppose
belongs to Mr. Selby.” And Minnie blushed again
as a pair of large, brown eyes met hers with an unequivocal
glance of admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of said orbs began something like a
compliment; but there was an unnecessary tinkling
of the ice in Minnie’s glass, and she did not appear
to hear it. Besides, at that particular moment, Paul
leant forward, and asked for some information about a
planing machine; and the conversation turning on
inch-boards, weather-boards, and thousands of feet of
lumber, the ladies rose and left the table to adjourn
to the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry soon followed them—what cared he for
planing-mills? And Blanche made room for him by
Minnie, the place he evidently wanted, for he never
left it until his uncle called to her for some music,
and a “good old song.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately for him, young ladies play too well
now-a-days to require a book before them, and as there
were no leaves to be turned, Harry stood at a distance,
admiring the rapid little fingers as they flew
over the ivory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who taught you?” exclaimed he, as she ended
Rosellen’s pretty variations from Don Pasquale,
“who taught you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed to Kate, who nodded her head with
a proud smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
“Is it possible! When I get to Paris, I shall boast
of my countrywoman, Mrs. Linden, for I am confident—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the song of Minnie, the song!” interrupted
Mr. Selby senior. “I asked for a song, young lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, sir, but I will leave that to the rest,
as I can only boast of a few notes as yet.” And
Minnie rose and gave her place to Blanche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie does not like to show off unless she is
sure of creating a sensation,” said Mr. Linden,
laughing as she took her seat beside him. “If you
did but know, Mr. Selby, what a wonderful debut
she is prepared to make; all the young ladies will
hide their diminished heads next year at her first
Mazourka, and never dance again. Wont they,
Minnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You flatter me,” said she, smiling good humoredly.
“I only intend to be <span class='it'>one</span> of the stars—not
the bright particular one, for I have only my wits to
help me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they will be all sufficient,” said old Mr.
Selby, patting her cheek. “I’m sure of my little
pet’s entire success in the great world of fashion.
How many ball-dresses is Rose to bring across the
wide ocean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she has carte blanche,” returned she, “and
I will send for you as soon as they are unpacked,
that you may determine my first costume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the evening wore away, and the family separated
at an early hour, as the letters must be written
to Rose for the next morning. Each had a volume
to say, and Minnie’s exceeded the third page, as she
had promised such faithful accounts of home to the
wanderer, even the dogs were immortalized that
night, for an affecting account of Ponto’s regret for
his mistress drew tears from the writer’s own eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord bless us! what a correspondence,” exclaimed
Mr. de la Croix, as the letters were thrown
on the table. “Poor Rose will never get through it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a postscript from Kenneth, and myself,
of course,” said Paul, as he threw down a pretty envelope.
“An endless communication from Minnie,
six pages between Blanche and Kate, two from Lisa,
she being too sensible to waste time, and a well
filled sheet from you, sir. Rose will have work and
instruction for a week when all this reaches her.
Did you have a good pen, Minnie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I did,” replied she, looking up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I rejoice, for Rose’s sake, your calligraphy
being at times very Egyptian. However, Harry
Selby will take great pleasure in assisting her to
decipher it, I dare say; and I feel much relieved on
her account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minnie pulled his hair for him at this declaration,
and vowed revenge. Rose could read her writing
very well, though others might be dull enough to
suspect the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a charm about Minnie that was irresistible—it
was her unvarying good humor, her
sweet, even temper. Even while asserting her
willful but childish dislike of reproof it was impossible
to be angry with her. Nothing like an angry
retort ever passed her lips; as ineffectual as a reprimand
was to her wild spirit, she took it smilingly,
and disarmed displeasure with her winning ways.
No wonder that her sisters loved her; no wonder
they feared for her as years passed, and she was yet
untamed. Impulsive, obedient to these impulses, and
inconstant in her tastes, Minnie de la Croix, at the
age of seventeen, was no wiser than a child of ten.
If she offended she was wretched until she had been
forgiven, and as ready to pardon as she was averse
to wound. Her life had been one of sunshine and
love; but she was growing up to womanhood, and
dreamed not of its perils and its pains—saw nothing
but smiles and fair promises in the world before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose’s account of young Selby’s arrival in Paris
was satisfactory to all parties. “He came to see
us,” wrote she, “as soon as he arrived, taking time
only, as I suppose, to make himself look remarkably
handsome under a French valet’s hands. He greeted
me most affectionately, and I verily believe would
have kissed me upon slight encouragement. He
gave me news of my dear home, of my dearest
father and sisters; and if he had been as ugly as a
Chinese, I should have thought him an Adonis. He
tells me that you are all in perfect health, and describes
my Minnie as something very lovely. Very
bewitching, he said, and so very pretty. My resemblance
to her seemed to delight him; but as I am
neither of the two epithets bestowed upon her, I am
afraid it will wear off. We were at the Opera last
evening, and, of course, he joined us; but there was
no time to talk when Jenny Lind was singing, and
I could not have heard him if he had attempted it, I
was so absorbed; but he had too much taste for such
a mistake. We spend this evening at the American
Minister’s, where I am to see a whole cage of French
lions; and what is better, some of my own dear
countrymen. I am delighted with the grace and
ease of the Parisian ladies—it is impossible to resist
their fascination of manner, the very lifting of their
veils is a tableau in itself. Minnie’s numberless
dresses for next winter I shall choose under the surveillance
of one of our new acquaintances, one of
the presiding goddesses of fashion, whose taste is
so infallible, that, if she were to have her bonnet
bent by accident, bent bonnets would suddenly become
the rage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot give all Rose’s letter, as it was a long
one, but must hurry over her return, and bring her
home in time for Minnie’s ball, as the whole house
called it. The dear absentee arrived in the midst
of the preparations, at the time appointed. Mr. de la
Croix wished to celebrate her happy return among
them with Minnie’s debut, and there was no end to
the joy of the sisters as they all met together once
more in the room wherein Rose’s boxes and trunks
had been carried. Mr. Linden was there with a
hammer, which he swung over their heads, as he
called out where he was to begin, and the door opened
to admit Mr. de la Croix, Kenneth, and Harry Selby’s
uncle. Minnie had promised, he said, that he should
choose her costume upon this great occasion, and
here he was, to do his duty conscientiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gladly welcomed, and Paul fell to work on
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
a large <span class='it'>caisse</span>, according to Rose’s directions. The
lid flew off and revealed a very mysterious covering
of white paper, which they proceeded to remove, and
Lisa’s nice hands were called upon to take out the
beautiful dresses that lay so lightly one upon the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful!” they cried, as a blue tarlatan of the
most delicate shade was held up. “Exquisite!
Who is this for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Lisa,” said Rose, displaying its beauties;
“and I have the most unexceptionable bouquets of
pink moss roses for the looping of the skirt, sleeves,
and one for the bosom. Now that white dress is
for Blanche—my Lady Blanche—and the two rose-colored
for Minnie and myself. All have flowers to
trim alike. You will find Kate’s in the other box—there
was no room for it in this one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is another white one,” said Minnie, who
had danced around the room in a perfect glee.
“Whose is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is yours also, Minnie,” answered Rose, with
an affectionate smile. “You will want more than
one ball-dress, my little debutante. Then—here
Paul! Paul! to your duty—open this box. Mr.
Selby! you have something to do with this, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All eyes turned to him as he came forward with a
queer smile from the window at which he and Mr.
de la Croix sat looking on, and enjoying the scene of
gayety and confusion that passed before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I to do with boxes, my pretty Rose,”
inquired he. “I sent for no coats or pantaloons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you sent for the contents of this box, Mr.
Selby,” said she, nodding her head significantly.
“What they are, I know not; but Harry asked me
to let it come on with my baggage, as it was yours,
and to be opened at Oakwood. So here it is, and
as <span class='it'>I</span> have some curiosity about it, I call upon this
self-constituted carpenter to gratify it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down went Paul’s hammer and chisel, and the
nails gave way. More white paper—and many little
tape-strings running across, busied Lisa’s fingers for
some minutes. At length she drew out a dress so
beautiful that even Mr. de la Croix came forward.
It was of a most delicate texture, white, and embroidered
around the skirt in palms of silver. Nothing
could be more exquisite, and Lisa drew forth
gloves and slippers to correspond. There was still
a small box lying within, but as every one was exclaiming
over the shining robe, she deferred taking
it out until it was time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Selby! Mr. Selby! what did you want
with this dress? Tell us quickly—are you going to
be married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless Minnie will have me, for it is hers,”
said he, covering her with the lovely thing, and looking
half ashamed as she uttered a scream of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see a letter there for me—hush child! hush!
don’t mention it, that’s a good girl—I’m quite rewarded
by your pleasure; let us read Mr. Harry’s
communication.” He broke the seal and began
reading it aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear uncle, Madame de Rosiere went to the
modiste’s with me, and chose these articles as you
requested; being as perfect in taste and dress as she
is in wit, it must be a gem, almost worthy of the fair
creature for whom it is destined. (Hem! Harry is
eloquent.) As I knew where Miss de la Croix had
<span class='it'>her</span> dresses made, Madame de R. went with me
there, and arranged it all with the ingenuity of a
Frenchwoman—that this was to be made and packed
with the rest, though in a separate box, and sent to
Mr. Bliss’s hotel, when I asked him to take charge
of it according to your orders. It gave me the greatest
pleasure to attend to your commission, I do assure
you, and I must thank you for it. How I long to see
your favorite in a costume that seems to my poor
eyes, one that will robe her like an angel of light.
(Hurrah for the boy! he is really a gone case.) In
the small box you will find a—” here Mr. Selby muttered
the rest to himself, and ended with “your
affectionate nephew, etc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman then took out of a satin case
a fan so superior to any Minnie’s unpracticed eyes
had ever seen, that her admiration knew no bounds.
On the slender gold ring that passed through the
handle was her name in full, and to a chain of fine
workmanship was attached a ruby for her taper
finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Minnie is a spoiled child,” said her father, taking
the costly bauble and examining the pretty painting
upon it, an acquisition in itself. It represented a
young girl in the first bloom of youth with her arm
around the neck of a beautiful greyhound, that looked
up wistfully in her face. The attitude was full of
grace, not unlike Minnie’s own, and Rose smiled as
she remarked that Mr. Selby had chosen an emblem
of fidelity for her little sister’s study during ball-room
scenes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More probably as an example,” said his uncle,
with a meaning smile. “Harry can never be classed
among that portion of his sex, ‘to one thing constant
never,’ and he, in my humble opinion, would love to
communicate some of the same spirit to others.” A
sly glance at Minnie accompanied these last words;
but she was examining her fan very closely, and did
not perceive it. At length she went and laid her hand
upon his arm, looking up at him with a grateful expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been so very kind to me—so thoughtful
of my enjoyment in the world, that I cannot thank
you in words. Some of these days, like the mouse
proved to the lion, I may find a way to serve you,
but until then you must believe how deeply I feel
all this attention. Now come and choose my costume
for to-morrow night—shall I come out in all
the splendor of my white and silver?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear,” said Mr. Selby, kindly. “You
must be like Rose to-morrow, and wear the other
when my sister gets my old-fashioned house in
readiness for another party, where you will receive
the guests as your own. Now let me kiss that soft
cheek, and run away to my business in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And not see all <span class='it'>my</span> presents, Mr. Selby!” exclaimed
Rose. “They cannot equal yours, but I
have some very choice specimens of porcelain, besides
collars, capes, etc. Now look at this transparent
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
lamp-shade, with the angels’ heads; and see
these vases. Here is a coffee-cup for papa, one for
Paul and Kenneth, with their initials, and here is an
inkstand for my darling Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is for Lisa and Blanche?” asked he,
admiring each as she presented them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lamp is for my industrious queen bee, Lisa,
the vases for Blanche, and things innumerable for
the rest. You do not care about seeing the ‘dry
goods,’ I know, but wait until I show you some of
my own work. I have embroidered three vests for
my three pets—papa and ‘the brothers,’ besides a
scarf for my friend, Mr. Selby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was delighted at the idea of being remembered
by her while in a distant land, and Rose
was forced to send him away to get rid of his
thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They hurried over the rest of the unpacking, as
many preparations were needed for the next day’s
fête, and were soon running about from one room to
the other, laughing and singing as in days gone by.</p>

<p class='line'>With her raven tresses falling loosely down her neck of snow,</p>
<p class='line'>And her cheek all flushed with crimson, like the morning’s richest glow,</p>
<p class='line'>From a covert, Theodora, like a loosened sheaf of light,</p>
<p class='line'>Burst, with wild and ringing laughter, in upon my wildered sight.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Like a golden dream she came to me, and like a dream she fled,</p>
<p class='line'>Crushing crystal dews beneath her, as the diamonds in their bed;</p>
<p class='line'>And a spirit seemed to linger round the covert whence she came,</p>
<p class='line'>As a glow is oft reflected from the brightness of a flame.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Far within the solemn forest disappeared her sylphide form,</p>
<p class='line'>As the gentle star of even pales before presaging storm;</p>
<p class='line'>Every songster’s notes were silent, all the wild-flowers wore a blush,</p>
<p class='line'>And throughout the wood’s dark mazes was a calm and holy hush.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Such a gush of richest melody as then bestirred the air,</p>
<p class='line'>In my soul awakened echoes that had long been slumb’ring there;</p>
<p class='line'>’Twas a harmony angelic, that her spirit caught at birth,</p>
<p class='line'>And she poured it out in mellow floods, as one of common worth.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Straight she hied her to a fountain, that lay sleeping in the glen—</p>
<p class='line'>’Twas a fountain hidden deeply from the common gaze of men;</p>
<p class='line'>Greenest mosses grew about it, walling up its crystal wealth,</p>
<p class='line'>Save a silver ribbon that escaped its velvet lip by stealth.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>On its smooth and argent surface fell the tears that Dryads wept;</p>
<p class='line'>In its deep, unruffled bosom sweetest dreams serenely slept;</p>
<p class='line'>Not a human face could ever have intruded on the calm</p>
<p class='line'>That was reigning all around it, like the fragrance from a balm.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>As she drew, unguarded, nigh it, gently seemed the waters stirred;</p>
<p class='line'>For the music of her voice was as the warbling of a bird:</p>
<p class='line'>And the sheet of liquid crystal, that was slipping o’er the rim,</p>
<p class='line'>For a moment fairly quavered, ere it parted from the brim.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Coming nearer, then she spied it—this sweet mirror hidden there—</p>
<p class='line'>All set round with greenest mosses, and arbuscles fresh and rare;</p>
<p class='line'>And she clapped her hands delighted, as she hastened to its side,</p>
<p class='line'>And she shouted with a melody that thrilled its mimic tide.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Then she sat her down beside it, and with hand pressed to her zone,</p>
<p class='line'>Thus a moment sat she silent, in her wonderment alone;</p>
<p class='line'>Raven ringlets trembled slightly, lustrous eyes beamed wondrous bright,</p>
<p class='line'>As she gazed upon the crystal that lay sleeping in her sight.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Bending downward yet more lowly, till the wave her tresses swept,</p>
<p class='line'>She essayed to look beyond the brink, where Heaven’s cerulean slept;</p>
<p class='line'>But she started as she caught the face so beautiful and fair</p>
<p class='line'>That was looking up into her own from out the lakelet there.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Throughout all her wildered senses sped a feeling of affright;</p>
<p class='line'>Yet the tremor was well tempered with a sweet, unknown delight:</p>
<p class='line'>And she gazed into the large blue eyes that met her from below,</p>
<p class='line'>And she thought they peered from out a world beneath the <a id='water'></a>waters’ flow.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Then a blush of richest crimson mounted up unto her cheek,</p>
<p class='line'>And a smile enwreathed her parted lips, as if she fain would speak;</p>
<p class='line'>But yet while she looked still steadfastly, the face below it smiled,</p>
<p class='line'>And Theodora clasped her hands, with seeming transport wild.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Every day thereafter went she, as a nun within her cell,</p>
<p class='line'>To the little crystal cloister there imbedded in the dell:</p>
<p class='line'>And as every time she looked within, she saw an angel-face—</p>
<p class='line'>Upon each reflected feature read the words of truth and grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the battle in which De Haye, the maître-de-camp
was killed, and the Portuguese ran away
to a man, leaving the French to maintain the honor
of the day and their ultimate position on a hill near
at hand, the Spanish army unbuckled their armor
and sat down to stretch their limbs beside the fires
at which their suppers were cooking; and if any one
in camp lost appetite that evening, it was not because
of the numberless gaping wounds witnessing
to Heaven against him from the field behind. A
mile or so above, a few scattered lights showed
where the remnant of De Chaste’s army held
ground, and awaited the morrow with little fear but
much hunger, sending to perdition the viceroy and
entire Portuguese nation the last thing before dropping
to sleep: midway between these two rows of
fires, was neither life nor light save such as a crescent
moon gave, and as much as lingered in some
poor wretch with more vitality than was best for
him. In which middle space the Damon and Pythias
of this story, Hilo and Carlo, prowled about,
turning over the stiff carcasses in search of valuables,
for nothing of convertible worth came amiss
to the pair, whose personal property was staked
nightly at dice. Occasionally an apparent corpse
tossed about his arms and legs convulsively, or
prayed in a husky whisper for a little water, for life
and mercy’s sake a single draught; but in either
case the Walloon, like a rough angel of mercy as he
was, put an end to their anguish promptly, saying
with a grin to Hilo—“You know it’s for his good I
do it: if he drank any thing it might keep him alive
till somebody who aint his friend comes round. It
would be a heap harder to die after making up his
mind he was to live again, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which Hilo replied with some contempt: the
boy was ferocious, as has been elsewhere said, only
on provocation—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re fitter for a hangman than a soldier, serjeant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A truth Wolfang took for a compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey?” cried that cidevant free-captain suddenly,
“here’s one of our officers, let’s turn him over. A
hole in the back of his casque by Lucifer; it served
him right for turning his back on the enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hilo may have recognized the whereabouts sufficiently
to make a tolerably fair guess before the
other added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—oh—the maître-de-camp, De Haye!” But
if he did he held his peace, and assisted in ridding
the dead cavalier of a few personals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Walloon was thick-skulled, but his long
service in villany had increased his cunning as a
matter of course, and a duller man than he, acquainted
with Señor de Ladron’s peculiarities,
might have jumped to a like conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! he wasn’t a coward after all. The arquebuse
that sent this ball was behind him while he
faced the Dons. The man you owe a grudge to had
better keep awake, Hilo, my lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a fool,” Hilo returned. “Hold your
tongue. Do you wish to bring the Spaniards upon
us with your noise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which the other answered sullenly—“You
talk as if I wasn’t more than your slave. You’d
better mind what you’re about. I aint going to
stand it always, even if—here now, what’s to be
done with these papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that shining in your hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A locket, or something of the sort, he had in
his breast. Hang it, you want every thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A locket!” cried his comrade quickly. “Give
it here.” Which the other did unwillingly, and the
other pocketed after holding it up to the light.
Hilo’s mood up to this moment had been none of the
sweetest, as the captain could testify, but some virtue
existed in the appropriation which was quite
irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, old fellow,” he cried to the serjeant, in
high good-humor, “I was rather sharp with you
just now, <a id='was'></a>wasn’t I? You know I’m quick and all
that, and musn’t mind me. Here’s a handful of
ducats for your locket, as you found it; I fancy the
thing, and don’t grudge paying for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gift the captain took with a growl half of resentment,
for <span class='it'>he</span> had not found a charm for himself,
and could not so easily forget an offense as his
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was wonderful what a dog to fetch and carry
that uncouth animal was to Hilo; how he followed
him about, drew dagger in his service, and exposed
his life any time rather than suffer the latter to embark
alone in a perilous venture, a thing his youthful
friend was much given to. It would have been
an unanswerable proof of the existence in all men
of some good trait, some capacity to love a brother,
for a worse rogue than the captain would be difficult
to select. But, unhappily, this Netherlandish Damon
had sounder, if less sentimental, reasons for
sticking by his Pythias. Hilo, a wonderfully precocious
youth, had fallen in with the honest captain
some three or four years back, and dexterously
turned to his personal advantage a comfortable sum
brought over from Peru by the other. “I like the
boy, he’s full of pluck. I’ll school him into the
ways of the world, look ye,” the captain used to
say, at the very time his protégé was scheming to
possess his ingots.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
“I knew his father in Peru very well, a man of
money. He lent me a helping hand once, and I
don’t mind turning about and lending the boy any
thing I have,” he spoke later. And so, not because
of the helping hand, as the captain wished understood—which,
to be sure, was Carlo’s beginning in
life, the elder De Ladron having taken him into
temporary partnership in the matter of a forced <span class='it'>repartimiénto</span>
which turned out golden—but because
he had entire reliance in the magnitude of the
senior’s estate, he made over to Hilo the bulk of his
possessions, on conditions legally witnessed, of a
fourfold return immediately on the other’s receiving
his own. No doubt Hilo acted in good faith, less
from inclination possibly than necessity, his money
affairs having become rather intricate about that
time, and there could be no question of the repayment
of the full amount—the original was no trifle—at
the season specified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when was that to arrive? A question Carlo
asked himself with growing dissatisfaction not long
after the last ducat had slipped through his debtor’s
fingers. Hilo was in no hurry to marry the girl,
and since signing the captain’s bond, had bestowed
his affections elsewhere, as people say. A French
countess, black-eyed and brisk, took his fancy much
more than the blonde his betrothed, and during the
stay of the French embassage at Madrid, the young
gentleman was on good behavior—ostensibly at
least. Of all her gallants none excited his jealousy
so much as a cavalier who had accompanied the
count unofficially, and stood high in his daughter’s
favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Hilo’s way of removing an obstacle of this
sort, was admirably illustrative of his sense of
wrong, although sometimes, as in this instance,
liable to miscarry. He first picked a quarrel with
De Haye, and that gentleman refusing point-blank
to fight so disreputable a party, was waylaid and
killed by proxy in the person of Villenos, who was
of much the same figure, and, as it chanced that
night, similarly attired. The eclat of this mistake,
added to the departure of the lady, took him to
France, where information of De Haye’s joining the
commandant induced him to enlist under the same
knight’s pennon, in pursuance of his vengeful purpose,
and the young blood-hound was of course nothing
molified by the remonstrance of his enemy to
De Chaste on shipboard, which Carlo repeated with
some little exaggeration, to be expected from the
mouth of so affectionate a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy, cunning, ex-free-captain was brow-beaten
and domineered over by his former protégé
in a truly surprising manner to one not in the secret.
It was wonderful how much he bore, how assiduously
followed at the heels of his junior when off
duty, uneasy at losing sight of the latter. The truth
was, the captain having gambled and squandered
himself into poverty again, looked to the money to
be derived from Hilo’s fortune for a means of reputable
living, as he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was an honest soldier till I met that Hilo!”
was his lament years after, while awaiting the hour
of his execution. And it was the obduracy of the
same young gentleman, aided by his own failure to
win the heiress, which had reduced him to the necessity
of relying upon Hilo’s attaining his twenty-fifth
year and sole right of property; a fib, by the
way, of the party interested, which the captain was
by this time too near gone not to catch at with proverbial
eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can only keep him in sight,” he used to
think fifty times a day with an oath, “until I get
back my ducats, I’ll take pay for my dog’s life;”
and at <a id='night'></a>nights he would wake muttering the words
and feeling the edge of his weapon, when Hilo
would exclaim—“Can’t you leave off grinding your
tusks in that savage fashion, you Dutch boar!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain saw how a little misadventure in the
shape of his dear young friend’s decease, might deprive
him of all chance of restoration, and no mother
could be more precious of her charge: Hilo might
involve himself in difficulties and be slain in a brawl;
it was this worthy soul’s chief business to guard
against such a mishap, or extricate him when fairly
in: or he might fly into an ungovernable rage and
harm himself, or tempt the captain into doing so;
so the latter eschewed all cause of contention, and
humbled himself where humility became a necessity.
For Carlo’s phlegmatic temperament was incapable
of fear, and nothing would have gratified
him more than a bout with the young gentleman—who,
seeing his advantage, or from mere recklessness,
tried his ability to bear and forbear to the utmost
limit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till I get my ducats back!” Wolfang consoled
himself with muttering under his breath on
such occasions, champing his jaws and keeping his
fingers stalwortly from his dagger-hilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair were standing over the body of the
maître-de-camp, Carlo with the papers in his hand
taken from the breast of the dead lieutenant’s
doublet, when Hilo cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark! the camp is in motion yonder above.
Come, Wolf, stir your clumsy legs before we are
missed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Wolfang trotting after his master thrust the
crumpled missives into his own doublet—“It’s no
use to throw away any thing in the dark,” he said;
“I did a note of hand once so, and somebody else
got the good of it; one of these days I’ll find time
to spell it out”—where they remained many days,
now and then taken out and returned, without much
progress made in their elucidation, for the warlike
captain was not much of a scholar, and found opportunity
for only cursory examinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A destination very different was the captain’s
pocket, it may be remarked, from that designed by
the writer, Don Pedro, who, about the time Carlo
pocketed the letters, was conversing with Señor
Inique as to their efficiency in De Haye’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man is absolutely penitent at the start; some
fear for character, personal safety, or the like, is the
prime mover, after which—it may be moments or
years after—enters in a godly sorrow for sin committed.
Sift your motives, exemplary reader, and
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
satisfy yourself for once, your conscience is not the
tender prompter to your most virtuous deeds you
imagine: something to the effect, what it, or the
world, or the church, or your wife at home will
think, has its due influence. Human nature is not
to be taken to task on this account; we are all more
selfish than we choose to admit even to ourselves,
or there would be an end straightway of all murders,
thefts and villanies great and small and of
every kind; and there is so little native good in us
it is best not to cavil at the source of any redeeming
trait, whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Don Augustino after ten years’ penitence of
fear, made confession for the first time of the same;
not with the best conclusion or purpose in view, it
may be objected, but the honest knight’s expressions
of opinion were scarcely adapted to producing a
better feeling at the beginning. Sir Pedro thought
as much himself when he reviewed the conversation,
and his after arguments were such as the mild
expression of his fine gray eyes lent effect to, a thing
they very seldom did when his speech was pointed
with sarcasm. The soldier was first molified, then
thoroughly subdued, and in the end inclined to adopt
the counsel of his ancient companion-in-arms, who
now, as always, took the shortest available course
to the doing away of a bad deed by substitution of a
good. Not that all this ripening of virtue in the
veteran sinner’s breast was much hastened by the
knight’s eloquence; it was mainly by the inexplicably
swift thaw after the ice has been broken
through with throes of dissolution, and something
the knight’s words may have done at the beginning
to aid the breaking up, something at the end to temper
the freshet. What he saw when he entered the
inner cabin of Inique’s ship, of that blank face and
imbecility, I have nothing to relate; let the door remain
shut upon him as it was in Inique’s time, and
all likeness and constraint of the unhappy inmate be
left to the imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entire restitution of name and property on one
side, and public avowal of his paternity on the other,
was what the straight-forward adviser urged, and
Inique consented ultimately to perform. Avowed
penitence strangely humbled the misshapen pride of
the man. Once he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were right, Padilh; I was a coward from
first to last. I begin to perceive there are two sorts
of courage, one infinitely superior to the other, and
God alone knows how much braver than I this poor
boy might have proved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main obstacle now to be overcome was the
will of the supposititious Hilo, whose rage at finding
himself heir to nothing would be likely to exceed
all bounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be opened gently,” said the knight.
“The boy has an ill name for violence, and some
gain must be shown as an equivalent for so much
pecuniary loss; which last, I fear, will be the chief
occasion of regret with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have some little property of my own remaining,”
answered the other, “and would gladly relinquish
it in his favor, but for the claims of my
other child. As for me, I am sick of this world’s
honors—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh!” cried Padilh cheeringly, “is this your
new-found bravery? Look how you retreat before
the enemy, and hope to shelter yourself behind a
wall with monks. And as for your blue-eyed daughter,
have no concern at all, for by this time I am
sure that motherless countess of mine would stand a
siege rather than surrender her unconditionally: we
have more than we want in property and less in
children, so you and I can each satisfy the other’s
need and our own pleasure, which will be stealing
a march at the start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man of care and crime was sensibly touched
by this offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many thanks!” was all he said, but he took his
associate by the hand with a grasp that would make
you or I wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think with you; he must be appealed to indirectly
at first, that his suspicions may not be awakened
too soon,” Don Pedro said shortly after, in
answer to Inique. “In the French camp is a gentleman
whose honor is unquestionable, and who entertains
such friendship for me, he would not hesitate
to undertake the service. If you do not oppose
the design, I will write him a short narrative of the
events, leaving the manner and time of communication
to his judgment to determine. Until his
jealousy of your present purpose is overruled, we
may scarcely hope to meet the wretched boy in person,
and I can see no better way of gaining our
end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it be so, I oppose nothing honorable,” replied
the maître-de-camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not referring to my old scale of honor,” he
added presently, with something like a blush.
There is hope for the man, thought Padilh thereupon;
which was true enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight wrote the letter in accordance with
this agreement, a brief recapitulation of the events
of Inique’s life and his own, many of which De
Haye already knew, urging that cavalier to use his
discretion in acquainting the false Hilo de Ladron
with so much of the truth as would suffice to induce
an interview, by assuring him of no harm being
plotted against his person, but rather some gain intended.
Which letter Don Pedro contrived to have
placed in De Haye’s hands the night before the battle
in which the latter fell by the arquebuse of the boy
whose cause he had at heart; for very nearly the
last thought of this generous fellow, forgetting the
enmity of Hilo, and perhaps rather careless of his
rivalry even when disencumbered of the Señorita
Inique, was that, after the day’s work was over, he
would play the ambassador to what purpose he
might: but it was Capt. Carlo that returned to camp
with the letter instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gallant captain hurrying back with his gay
companion, found preparations making for a night
attack, which were, however, countermanded before
the column began the descent. The men had
had their fill of fighting for the day, and turned in
again wondering and grumbling at the useless disturbance.
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
Meanwhile the commandant and the
viceroy were discoursing of what had best be done,
in the former’s tent. Senhor de Torrevedros, after
the battle, had arrived with about a thousand of his
countrymen, and one fourth or so the number of
cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The viceroy has brought milk for his babies at
last,” the French soldiers said sarcastically; and
the officer on duty who announced the arrival to De
Chaste, prefixed an epithet to the count’s title by no
means delicate or complimentary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the devil’s name, sir count,” the commander
exclaimed, with a red spot in either sallow cheek,
“do you fetch these cattle to mount your cuirassiers
or feed our troops?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither, at present, Senhor Commander,” the
unabashed viceroy replied; “for in neither way
could they so much benefit you as in their present
condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak your mind freely, we are friends here,
sir count,” the commandant answered coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our valor is too well known to be questioned—second
only to that of the French nation,” the count
said braggartly, lifting his plumed cap by way of
salute; “and I bring you, Senhor Commander, what
no man may cavil at, a thousand men brave as lions
and pledged to fall in defense of their king’s honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which speech a sarcastic smile passed round
the group of attentive officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” cried one to his comrade, “the fellow’s
talk sickens me. Let’s go to sleep again, there will
be nothing but gabble to-night.” And the two strode
away. “Stay,” whispered the more curious, “we
must hear the end of this bull story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regardless of all which the viceroy continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, sir, on the word of a knight, these long-horned
cows you affect to despise are more to be relied
on as allies than twice the number of men I
bring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless,” the veteran rejoined, stroking his
grizzled beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand your double meaning, Senhor de
Chaste,” Torrevedros said, slightly disconcerted.
“But had you been present at a former descent of
the Spaniards, when we routed five hundred infantry
by driving half the number of wild cows upon
them, you would not scoff at my design.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! prove ourselves boors, and go to battle
behind a herd of cattle with goads for lances!” here
broke in the commandant with great indignation.
“By St. Dennis and the devil, sir count, sir viceroy,
you make my old blood boil to hear you talk. And
I tell you once for all before these gentlemen here
present, whose scornful laughter, as you may see,
is only restrained by their good-breeding, that your
offer in no respect suits the style of warfare practiced
by knights and Frenchmen, although it may
serve the purpose of cowards and Portuguese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care! sir commandant,” cried the governor
threateningly, stung to anger; “take care what
you say in the hearing of a knight of that nation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have said my say,” the sturdy soldier answered
shortly, turning his back on the speaker and stalking
into his tent, where the other followed him after
some consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There the two commanders conversed at length,
and with rather more harmony than the beginning
promised; for De Chaste was not apt to bear a
grudge long, and the smooth Portuguese would have
kissed the other’s shoes if no other way offered for
saving his precious life and limbs. The former,
apart from his chivalric prejudices, and weighing
the proposal simply as an expediency, refused to
permit the employment of the horned reinforcement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might as readily be turned against our
battalions,” he justly remarked, “as Philip of Macedon’s
elephants were, in some battle I’ve forgotten
the name of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commandant probably meant Pyrrhus, but
his vocation being arms, not letters, he need not be
undervalued by recent graduates who know better.
One thing was now clear, the French had only
themselves to look to, since the long expected recruits
of the viceroy turned out to be a herd of cows,
and a night attack was secretly ordered, which recalled
the captain and Hilo to camp, but which the
return of the count and his expostulations caused to
be abandoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can learn nothing of the force and real position
of the enemy, what obstacles lie between, nor
who can guide you,” urged the alarmed governor
plausibly; “and as for my men, I know not one who
will be bribed or forced into a position so perilous.”
Which appeared so truthful that the fiery Frenchman,
with as bad a grace as any of his subordinates,
betook himself to bed again after personally making
the round of the Portuguese camp. All these swore
by all the saints to stand to their posts. They were
terrible fellows, fire-eaters and the like, at their own
showing; but the commander was scarce asleep
when Torrevedros reappeared with a confused air
and the information that the entire division had
stolen off and dispersed. Where the French general
consigned his allies need not be repeated to polite
ears, and I think his confessor, if he had one, should
by no means have ordered a severe penance for
what he said under provocation so grievous. A
council of the chief cavaliers was immediately
called. Alas! the most chivalric of them all lay at
the foot of the hill without a word to offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count spoke first, and strongly advised retreat
to a higher mountain, by which the approaches to
the interior might be readily defended, and an abundance
of ammunition and provisions could be carried
there, with cannon enough to maintain the position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather let us throw ourselves into the fortress
of Angra,” cried Duvick, “Where, with our handful
of Frenchmen, we can defy the whole Spanish
army, backed by every Portuguese in the Azores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech drew a murmur of assent from the
council, but the viceroy answered with his usual
treacherous suavity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing to fear from my countrymen
on that score, Messires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, by the Mass!” cried half a dozen voices,
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
with some sardonic laughter; and the count turned
to the commandant again, biting his lip with suppressed
rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do as you please, Senhor de Chaste,” he said,
with as much calmness as he could assume. “You
are all masters here, I perceive, but I warn you
fairly beforehand, that the walls of Angra are no
better than a nut-shell, and the cannon of the marquis
will bring them down upon your hot heads in
less than twelve hours. Moreover, the place can
contain not more than two hundred soldiers, as
Heaven is my witness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which was as great a fib as ever knight told, but
quite as excusable as many, you ladies, are in the
habit of telling by proxy at all hours of the day and
at your front doors. I cannot see, for my part, how
the Count de Torrevedros could possibly have acted
otherwise under the circumstances, which approached
as nearly as any military predicament
may a civil, the not at home of mesdames out of
toilette. In short, the count had that same night
sent the keys of Angra by a trusty messenger to the
Marquis of Santa Cruz, with his complimentary
offer of services; an errand which the astute ambassador
acquitted himself of to admiration, by
leaving out the count and assuming the credit:
and at the same moment the viceroy was giving
his disinterested advice, no less a personage than
Don Augustino Inique was marching in with five
hundred men through the wide-open gates of the
fortress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This the commandant learned by daybreak the
next morning, at which early hour he was pushing
for the mountains in accordance with the advice of
Torrevedros, who had gone ahead, as people say
taking French leave. At the village of Nostre
Dame Dager de Loup, they heard further that the
governor had put off in a boat from the coast; and
the French army, debarred from the sea on one side
and Angra on the other, and now openly deserted
by the Portuguese, occupied the little town and began
immediately to throw up intrenchments before
the arrival of the Spaniards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must not think longer how best to live, but
most honorably to die,” De Chaste answered a few
of his young officers who grumbled at the want of
necessary stores. A fine, heroic answer, which
stopped the mouths of those high-spirited gentlemen,
but was less efficient in the case of the soldiery. It
must be confessed the estimable pair Hilo and the
serjeant were not a little responsible for this discontent;
hard work agreed with neither of their constitutions,
and before nightfall they had found opportunity
to exchange their views on the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d as lief be a galley-slave and be done with
it,” the serjeant muttered to Hilo, who was helping
him lift a load of sand out of the ditch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain,” returned the other, “you speak my
mind; and things are getting in such a state here the
sooner we draw our necks out of the noose the
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” replied Carlo, “but how is that to be
done, look you? The marquis will hang us up for
spies if we go over to them, and the count they say
has gone off in the last boat on this coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what if most of these Frenchmen went out
with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That alters the case,” cried the captain with his
old grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And somewhere about midnight the commandant
was roused by an uproar round the officers’ quarters,
which shewed what willing soil the ringleaders had
found to sow sedition in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kill your captains! I’ll begin with mine,” the
serjeant was roaring with a volley of oaths, and
menacing Captain Curzon with his halbert. The
fellow had found drink somewhere, and was raging
like a worried bull, his prominent bloodshot eyes
sustaining the resemblance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Curzon parried the thrust and would have cut him
down, when the voice of the commandant overtopped
the clamor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” he exclaimed, “do you plot to follow
our Portuguese allies! Go, every man of you who
chooses; we want none but brave men here, and
will bear with no others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may do for you to prate about, general
mine,” answered Señor de Ladron scoffingly, the
seditious talents of that young gentleman causing
him to be chosen captain of the insurgents, “but it
wont deceive men with their eyes open, hark ye!
We all know you’re only waiting a chance to
escape with your brave officers, and leave us to pull
an oar apiece in the Spanish galleys. Ha, ha! M.
de Chaste! Begone while you’re allowed, for you
see you’re outwitted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Insolent dog, to your quarters!” the knight
cried, advancing upon the speaker and striking him
with his sheathed sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Hilo, instead of falling back, foaming with
rage, seized a halbert with both hands, and was as
promptly fastened on by a dozen embracing arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, by St. Dennis! the general shan’t be
harmed!” as many more voices exclaimed. “Only
we’ll be ahead of him and go first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends,” answered De Chaste, with some indignation
in his voice, “you hurt me more by your
suspicions than if you ran a sword through my
body; and I take Heaven to witness, I will be the
last man to quit this island, and will die rather than
abandon any of you to the mercy of the marquis,
whose countrymen gave such instance of their treatment
of the French last year in the Floridas. Let
fifty or a hundred of you surround my house yonder,
and insure my stay: it will be time enough to dishonor
yourselves and nation when I set the example.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which the mutineers did for the present, despite
the taunts of their leader-elect, who, struggling
furiously with his captors, had all the while been
calling to the others to fall upon the officers, or loose
him and he would give them example. The commandant
was a favorite with the troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will wait until to-morrow,” they agreed
among themselves, “and general or no general, he
is a dead man if he lifts a finger to betray us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
Señor Hilo de Ladron, for his part, came to the
conclusion, after this failure, that the French camp
was no place for him, and communicated his views
to his faithful Damon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to have split his head open, he hadn’t
so much as a cap on to save it,” he said to Wolfang,
“and then we might have done as we pleased with
the rest. But, hang it, you’re such a liar, the men
only half believed the story from the first, and letting
him talk upset their resolution altogether. It’s
his turn now, and we must get out of this hornet’s
nest before daylight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where to go?” the captain asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are born to be drowned, you can stay behind,
you wont be safe otherwise,” Hilo answered
indifferently. “I’m for the mountains at first, and
who knows but I may find it to my interest in the
end to visit the marquis with the count for sponsor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if you keep such good company,” the captain
returned, with a grotesque bow and grin showing
his comprehension of Hilo’s plans, “I’m your
excellency’s humble servant!” And in an hour’s
time these fast friends had slipped through the line
of sentries, scaled the breast-work, and sat down to
wait for light a mile or two from camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impossibility of hearing ordinary discourse
at that distance will cause the finale of this story to
be very different from what it might have been under
more favorable circumstances. For a herald,
or courier, or valet, had just then arrived from the
camp of the marquis, at the intrenchments, bringing
a letter to the Commandant de Chaste, who presently
sent through the village to find Don Hilo, as
we all know now, without success.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY R. PENN SMITH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strolling through a cemetery, I beheld within
one of the enclosures a widow who had buried her
only child there, some two years before. I accosted
her, and tendered my assistance. “Thank you,”
she replied, “my task is done. I have been pulling
up the nettles and thistles that have overgrown little
Willie’s grave, and have planted mnemonies, heart’s
ease, and early spring flowers in their place, as
more fitting emblems of my child; and though they
may fail to delight him, they will remind me that
there is a spring time even in the grave, and that
Willie will not be neglected by <span class='it'>Him</span> who bids these
simple flowers revive. But is it not strange how
rank nettles and all offensive weeds grow over the
human grave—even a child’s grave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember you mourned grievously at losing
him, but trust time has assuaged affliction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Its poignancy is blunted, but memory is constantly
hovering around my child. Duty and reason
have taught me resignation; still I seldom behold a
boy of his age, but fancy pictures to me how he
would have appeared in the various stages of his
progress toward manhood. And then again I see
him like his father—and myself a proud and happy
mother in old age. True, you may call it an idle,
baseless dream; and so it is, but I cannot help indulging
in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dream on! the best of life is a dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We walked a few steps, and paused before an inclosure
where reposed the remains of a worthy man,
with nothing more than his unobtrusive name inscribed
upon a marble slab to designate his resting-place.
He was respected for his integrity and energy;
beloved for his utility and benevolence. Here was
no lying inscription, making the grave gorgeous, as
if monumental mendacity might deceive Divinity.
His record was elsewhere, traced by unseen fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are no nettles on that good man’s grave,”
said the widow. “I knew him well; weeds would
wither there; nothing but flowers should cover his
ashes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few young men at the time were idly passing.
They <a id='pause'></a>paused, when one tearing a weed from the pathway,
hurled it among the flowers, exclaiming, “Let
him rot there with weeds for his covering.” The
slumbering dust thus spurned had long sustained the
ingrate who now voided his venom upon the benefactor
who had fed him until there was no longer
faith in hope. The widow sighed; “And this is on
the grave of the good and just!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had Willie lived, he might have been such a
man, and such would have been his harvest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next tomb a brave soldier mingled his ashes
with the red earth of Adam. In his early career he
was placed in a position where daring energies alone
could command success. He succeeded, and was
rewarded by a nation’s approbation. No subsequent
opportunity occurred to acquire peculiar distinction;
and when he died, a shaft was erected commemorating
the most remarkable action of his life. His
tomb attracted the attention of some visiters who
read his epitaph. “Characteristic of the age!” exclaimed
one, throwing a pebble at the inscription,
“to swell a corporal to the dimensions of a Cæsar.
It was the only action of a protracted life, worthy of
record, and here it is emblazoned for the pride of
posterity.” Had the thoughtless scoffer of the unconscious
dead occupied his position, which gained
renown, history possibly might have perpetuated
disgrace, instead of a tombstone record of gallant
services—the patriot’s sole reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew the soldier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For years, and well. A brave and worthy man.
The current of his useful life flowed smoothly on,
without being ruffled by the breath of calumny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet nettles cover his grave already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such might have been your child’s destiny—but
that matters little; praise or scorn are now alike to
the old soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We passed to a spot where a gay party was leaning
on a railing. A young woman had plucked some
of the gayest flowers from the enclosure, and was
laughing with her merry companions. As we approached,
she threw the bouquet already soiled and
torn, on the grave; and they went their way with
some idle jest upon their lips. The widow paused,
and struggled to suppress her emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know the tenant of this grave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From his childhood. He loved that woman, and
struggled to acquire wealth to make her happy. He
succeeded, and when she discovered that he was
completely within her toils, she deceived and left
him hopeless. There are men whose hearts retain
the simplicity of childhood through life; and such
was his. Without reproaching her, or breathing her
name to any one, he suddenly shrunk as a blighted
plant, and withered day by day, until he died. Like
the fabled statuary, he was enamored of the creature
his own mind had fashioned, and in the credulity of
his nature, he made her wealthy, trusting that time
would infuse truth and vitality into the unreal vision
of his youthful imagination. The world of love is
a paradise of shadows! The man beside her is now
her husband; the wealth they revel in, this grave
bequeathed them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fool! to die heart-broken—for a dream. But
great men have at times died broken-hearted. I
should not call him fool. It is a common death
among good men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great men! But women, sir, have pined away
to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In poetry, the bill of mortality is a long one; in
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
real life the patients seldom die, unless they chance
to be both vain and poor. Did a rich widow ever
grieve to death for the loss of the noblest husband?
Wealth is a potent antidote to the malady, and teaches
resignation; while poverty, with the first blow of
his iron sledge, will make his cold anvil smoke with
the heart’s blood, for he is buried who for years had
withstood the blow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That woman did not cast nettles on his grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No nettles, but faded roses which she tore from
it—blooming when she came there. Better cast
stones and nettles than those withered flowers.
Your boy has escaped this poor man’s destiny—the
worst of deaths! His was the happiest! he died—smiling—on
his fond mother’s bosom! But there
is a grave around which weeds grow more luxuriantly,
than about the sepulchre where mortal dust
reposes. Daily watchfulness is required to prevent
the bright creations therein buried, from being so
over-run until nothing is seen to designate the beautiful
tomb, where we had carefully embalmed them,
as if in amber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What grave, sir, do you refer to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The human mind. A mighty grave wherein
we daily bury crushed hopes and brilliant ephemerons,
too fragile to survive the chill atmosphere of a
solitary day. Keep the weeds from growing there
and smothering their memories. They are the progeny
of the soul, and should not be allowed to perish.
Shall the joyous and beautiful creations of childhood
be forgotten in age; must the noble aspirations of
the vigor of manhood pass away without even an
epitaph, because crushed in their vigor! Rather
contemplate them hourly; plant flowers beside them,
though they bloom but briefly and fade, they will
send forth perfume even in decay, and inevitably
revive in due season, bearing refreshing fruit; and
old age, with palsied hand, will readily gather up
the long account of his stewardship, and as he glances
over the lengthened scroll that must become a record
in the archives of eternity, may rejoice that
he hath not been an ingrate and idler in the heat of
the harvest-field, but hath diligently labored to make
the entrusted talent yield the expected usage. Tear
up the weeds that are incessantly growing there, ere
he who was placed little lower than the angels, becomes
an empty cenotaph—a stranger’s grave—mouldering
and mingling with his mother earth
unheeded and unknown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of our readers have undoubtedly been asked during the past month for information touching the whereabouts
of some trite quotation, the locality of which the whole neighborhood has not been able accurately to decide. We
have often thought it would be a commendable service if some industrious student would make a complete collection
of the every day sayings, and print them side by side with the author’s names. As no one, however, has seen fit to
pioneer in the attempt, we here make a beginning, confident that the plan is worthy to be carried out more fully. At
some future period, if no one else seems willing to continue the undertaking, we hope to find leisure and opportunity
for other specimens in “Graham.” Meantime, here are a few of the more common <span class='it'>lines</span> in “everybody’s <span class='it'>mouth</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful summer afternoon. The high
trees cast long shadows on the grass, and the glorious
golden sunlight beamed richly over the landscape.
In a thickly wooded park, whose long, winding
walks were bordered by the rhododendron, and overshadowed
by forest-trees, were several young girls.
They were simply dressed, and quite young, at the
season of early girlhood—thirteen, fourteen, and
fifteen might have been their ages—certainly not
older. They were all graceful, delicate little creatures—American
girls and women almost always are,
as foreigners have remarked. Two or three only,
however, were decidedly pretty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am tired of walking,” said one; “let’s stop
here a little while, and play something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl had well chosen the spot, for it was beautiful
enough to have tempted the faërys—if any there
be—to make of it, a play-ground. The wood skirted
a stream, rising from its shores in little undulating
hills, and the owner had availed himself of this, in
arranging the walks in his wood, so that by slightly
assisting Nature, these walks seemed terraced.
The place selected, was where one of the walks
widened a little—the hilly terrace rose gently behind
it, forming a turfy bank that served for seats,
and forest-trees crested the little summit of this hill.
Beneath the walk, the ground-swell shaded by trees,
sloped down to the stream-side, and between the
foliage could be seen the glittering wavelets, dancing
along in the golden atmosphere shed around them by
the glorious setting sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had these little rambling girls been a shadow
older, or breathing a more poetic imaginative atmosphere
than their sunny American home, they might
have sat and dreamed romances, out of “old
Poesy’s Myths,” and fancied that,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“That spring head of crystal waters,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Babbled to them stories of her lovely daughters,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;The beauteous blue-bells and the lilies fair.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But no! the influences of their associations in
their home-lives, rendered their imaginations—for
imaginations they had—less dreamy, less poetical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This work-day atmosphere in which we striving,
success-seeking Americans live and breathe, deprives
even our childhood’s day-dreams of romance
and poësy, and who can say whether it be well or
not? The mysterious voice of the Past says, “All
that is permitted is needed,” therefore, let this American
Judaic spirit roll on, the Nineteenth Century
needs it, to perform her part of the world’s development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we return to our little wood-ramblers and listen
to their gossip, we shall see how tangible and real
were the subjects of their day-dreams, though quite
as improbable, apparently, as the old imaginings of
Enchantment and Faëry Land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” lisped a little coquettish thing, the pet evidently
of the group, whose light, floating ringlets
threw faint shadows over her round, white shoulders,
“let’s play that I’m a duchess, and you are all come
to visit me at my ducal palace. These are my grounds,
and some of you shall be my ladies.” Thereupon
the little witch threw her faëry form on the turfy
bank, in a languishing position, and prepared to
take upon her little self, all the state and dignity of
a duchess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I for one,” said the tallest of the group,
although the rest seemed half disposed to enter into
the proposed play. “If there’s to be any duchess
playing, I’ll be the titled lady. Yes, I will be your
princess, and hold here my regal court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If princesses have a divine right to beauty, the
girl might have been one of the most royal. She
had, for so young a girl, a presence and bearing remarkable
for dignity, and her form gave promise of
fine development. Her head was well placed on a
beautiful neck and drooping shoulders. Her rich,
dark hair was cut short and brushed back from a
low Medicean brow, and it clustered in thick, close
curls around the back of her well-shaped head and
white neck. Although her brow was low, and her
chin almost voluptuously full, her keen, black eyes,
arched <a id='eye'></a>eye-brows, that in some moods almost met
over a nose that was delicate and handsome in shape,
and whose nostrils trembled and dilated with every
shadow of feeling, and a mouth well shaped, but firm
in expression, all told that the girl had a haughty,
imperious spirit, one such as a princess might have;
and she carried herself as though she would have
said, as Marie Antoinette did, when some one remarked
her erect bearing,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
“Were I not a queen, I suppose, people would
call me insolent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Duchess and princess indeed!” exclaimed one
of the girls, contemptuously. “How absurd to talk
such nonsense. Who ever heard of such duchesses
and princesses as you’d make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not, mademoiselle?” asked the would-be
princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Caro is grand,” laughed one of the girls;
“don’t you take notice, girls, she always calls us
mademoiselles, when she wants to take state?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl repeated her question, haughtily, without
heeding the saucy interruption. Her manner
seemed to intimidate the other, and pleased with her
apparent victory, she continued, drawing herself up
to her full height, and looking even more stately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will be a princess. Why should I not
be? My grandmother was a queen, and my great
uncle an emperor. I will give you all grand
titles, too. You, Lina, I will make a countess, for
you are too little and delicate, pet-bird, to be a
duchess—that sounds too matronly for you; but as
for you, Mademoiselle Helen, you shall only be a
simple maid of honor, and may be, lady of the bed-chamber
after awhile, if you stop sneering at my
rank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh Caro and Lina,” said Helen, impatiently,
“don’t be so silly; it is ridiculous. You are always
spoiling our walks with these foolish make-believes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Mademoiselle Helen?”
asked Caro, with flashing eyes, and nostrils dilating
with unrepressed indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean just what I say, Caro; that you always
make yourself absurd and disagreeable by wanting
us to play such vain, silly plays; and you do Lina
no good either, for her little head is filled now with
nothing else but nonsensical notions that will give
her a great deal of trouble. I am a year or two
older than you, Miss, and can see the folly of all
this; but even if I were not, I hope I should not be
such a silly little fool as to try to imagine I was
something grander than I was not, and what is more,
never will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro’s face grew crimson, and she bit her full, red
lip until the rich blood nearly started from it while
she listened to this irritating speech. When it was
concluded, she threw up her head and exclaimed in
a voice choked with passion,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This comes of associating with plebians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plebians, indeed!” said Helen, indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, plebians, mademoiselle,” answered Caro,
looking steadily and haughtily at her. “You are a
plebian when compared with me, for my grandmother
was a crowned queen, and my uncle the
great Emperor Napoleon; am I not, then, a princess
of most regal descent? And you, Lina, darling,”
she continued, putting her arm patronizingly around
the little creature, “I only hope I may be as my
grandmother was, a throned queen, then I would
do more than put grand notions in your head. I
would put great titles to your name, and brave retinues
to back them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, your mother, most royal princess,”
said the annoying Helen, with provoking coolness,
“has the misfortune, however, at present, to be the
instructress of the daughter of a plebian country
lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a misfortune, mademoiselle,” answered
Caro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls drew together a little frightened; they
knew a crisis was coming, for many times before
had they witnessed similar “passages at arms,” between
the two girls, but never such a threatening
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind Caro,” said little Lina, “let’s leave
Helen; she’s always so cross, and says such ill-bred
things. We’ll go and play by ourselves. You <span class='it'>shall</span>
be our queen, and I will be your little countess, or
any thing you want me to be. The girls will go
with us, too; wont you, girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha!” laughed the now irritated Helen, for
she saw that most of the girls were disposed to take
Caro’s part. “This is amusing, truly, to see the
daughter of a plain American country store-keeper
playing countess, and the granddaughter of a French
inn-keeper taking state and royal airs over simple
republicans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen’s tantalizing expressions might have caused
one thing royal—a “battle royal”—for, although
they were little young ladies, they were sometimes
apt to forget the rules of good breeding daily enjoined
upon them—but fortunately they were interrupted.
Some ladies joined them—mothers and elder sisters
of the girls; for this park-like wood was a favorite
afternoon resort for the inhabitants of the little
village of B——. The angry retort trembled on
Caro’s tongue, and frowning glances were exchanged
between them; for awhile their quarrel was suspended—but
only for awhile; the next day would
be sure to renew the scene. After a little talk with
the ladies, Caro and Lina withdrew to another part
of the grounds, followed by their adherents, which
we must confess, comprised the greater number of
the school; and the sturdy little republican, Helen,
was in the minority, for only two or three of the
older girls espoused her cause. As they left, one
of the remaining girls whispered to Helen, with a
merry laugh,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, Caro and Lina are going off to hold their
Court. Had we not better set up a rival one? We
will elect you lady president, or cabinet officer’s lady,
or senator’s wife. You would not, I suppose, take
any less republican title from us, and, of course, it
would be hardly safe or proper to send you ministress
plenipotentiary to adjust difficulties between
the two governments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen laughed contemptuously, as if she thought the
whole affair too childish to be noticed. But her little
heart was not much, if any, better than Caro’s and
Lina’s. Like theirs it swelled with anger and pride,
and although she was a good, sensible girl, she many
times permitted her temper and a spirit of envious
rivalry that had unconsciously sprung up between
her and Caro, to master her, and make her forget the
gentle courtesy and good-breeding which should
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
characterize every woman, whether republican or
aristocrat—because she is a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carriages rolled through the crowded streets of
Paris, and a gay crowd thronged to the residence of
the republican prince—the new French president.
A stately levee was to be held, and Josephine’s
grandson inherited Napoleon’s popularity! Time
had avenged <span class='it'>her</span> wrongs, and Fortune, which had
played such curious, elfish pranks with this great
family, had set them once more aloft, but at their
head she placed with strange justice the representative
of the dethroned, divorced empress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a brilliant sight. Ladies were there in
gorgeous costume, glittering with diamonds, and
gentlemen in full court-dress decked with orders.
Near the President stood a group of beautiful women—the
women of his family—his cousins, once,
twice, and thrice removed. Among them was a
lady who attracted the admiring gaze of more than
one passer-by. She had a majestic presence, though
still quite young—in the first flush of early womanhood.
Her face was as beautiful as her form, which
was faultless in its proportions. She had a clear,
rich skin—eyes by turns flashing and serene, under
“<span class='it'>level fronting eye-lids</span>”—a beautiful mouth, with
the full lips gently and sweetly parted, and a Napoleonesque
chin, that told her Buonaparte descent, with a
lovely dimple denting its centre. Her thick, glossy
hair was dressed with classical severity, for they
told her, her head was like the Princess Pauline’s,
and made her bind it with a broad coronet, woven
of her own rich hair. She was beautiful enough to
have inspired another Canova to sculpture her also
as a Venus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A buzz was heard, while the Russian Ambassador
presented a gentleman and lady with much consideration
to the president. The young cousin of
the president started, and a brilliant flush crimsoned
her cheek—whose only fault, if fault it could be,
was its delicate pallor—as she looked at the lady
newly presented, and heard her title—the Countess
O——.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The countess was a fair young creature with a
delicate sylph-like figure, and her hair fell in soft,
brown ringlets, as if wishing to burst from the confinement
of the jeweled comb and costly bandeau, in
order to shade her timid beauty. Many remarked
the purity and simplicity of her style, and low
murmurs told the inquiring stranger, that though
bearing a foreign name and title, she was said to be
an American.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd increased, and the circle around the
president gradually separated, making room for
the throng of <span class='it'>nobodys</span> who wished to be presented.
The hum of conversation grew louder, and
though the new president exacted much ceremony,
it was plain to be seen that etiquette did
not forbid the merry laugh, nor the sparkling
<span class='it'>repartée</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little group of ladies and gentlemen stood near a
window, laughing and chatting with all that sprightliness
with which the French people of society know
so well how to enliven conversation. Some of the company
passed by, promenading. A lady of the group at
the window, lifted her arm—it must have been
unconsciously, certainly it was done gracefully,
and in so doing, entangled her magnificent diamond
bracelet in the costly lace <span class='it'>berthé</span> of a lady passing
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of the offending bracelet was the
cousin of the President, the lady of the <span class='it'>berthé</span>
the fair Russian countess. The first bent over as
if to disentangle the sparkling clasp from the delicate
meshes of the lace, and her manner, repulsed
all offers of assistance from those standing
by. It seemed a difficult task, however, and she
had quite time enough to say more than the mere
apologies required, and surely she did say more
than those standing near them heard, for the
mere “Pardonnez moi Madame je vous prie,”
could not have caused the slight start which the
pretty little countess gave, nor the delicate flush
that tinged her fair temples, when the French lady’s
glowing cheek rested near hers, in bending down
to disentangle her ornament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lina,” said the president’s cousin, in a low,
laughing tone, that gurgled up like the melody
of foam-bells in a stream, “who would have
thought when Helen Morris used to laugh at
us in America, that our childish imaginings would
come true? Why, darling, you are not only a
countess, but you are wedded to the first and
oldest blood of Europe; and I, dear one—yes, I—if
not an acknowledged princess, will yet be a
queen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bracelet was disengaged—the <span class='it'>berthé</span> released.
The French lady made a low courtesy to
the countess, with her eyes bent upon the ground—and
they parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortune is a capricious goddess, and surely the
wildest, most improbable romances ever imagined,
could not surpass, scarcely equal, the strange reverses
the blind goddess of the wheel has brought
to the family of the great “World-Actor of the
Nineteenth Century,” <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>November is upon us—hearty, brown, healthful November,
harbinger of his best joys to the ardent sportsman,
and best beloved to him of all the months of the great
annual cycle; November, with its clear, bracing, western
breezes; its sun, less burning, but how far more beautiful
than that of fierce July, as tempered now and softened by
the rich, golden haze of Indian summer, quenching his
torrent rays in its mellow, liquid lustre, and robing the
distant hills with wreaths of purple light, half mist, half
shrouded sunshine; November, with its wheat and buckwheat
stubbles, golden or bloody red; with its sere maize
leaves rustling in the breeze, whence the quail pipes incessant;
with its gay woodlands flaunting in their many-colored
garb of glory; with its waters more clearly calm,
more brilliantly transparent than those of any other season;
November, when the farmer’s toils have rendered their
reward, and his reaped harvests glut his teeming garners,
so that he too, like the pent denizen of swarming cities,
may take his leisure with his gun “in the wide vale, or
by the deep wood-side,” and enjoy the rapture of those
sylvan sports which he may not participate in sweltering
July, in which they are, alas! permitted by ill-considered
legislation, in every other state, save thine, honest and
honorable Massachusetts.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth there is no period of the whole year so well
adapted, both by the seasonable climate, and the state of
the country, shorn of its crops, and not now to be injured
by the sportsman’s steady stride, or the gallop of his high-bred
setters, both by the abundance of game in the cleared
stubbles and the sere woodlands, and by the aptitude of
the brisk, bracing weather for the endurance of fatigue,
and the enjoyment of manful exercise, as this our favorite
November.</p>

In this month, the beautiful Ruffed Grouse, that mountain-loving,
and man-shunning hermit, steals down from
his wild haunts among the giant rhododendrons, and evergreen
rock-calmias, to nearer woodskirts, and cedar-brakes
margining the red buckwheat stubbles, to be found there
by the staunch dogs, and brought to bag by the quick
death-shot, “at morn and dewy eve,” without the toil and
torture, often most vain and vapid, of scaling miles on
miles of mountain-ledges, struggling through thickets of
impenetrable verdure among the close-set stems of hemlock,
pine, or juniper, only to hear the startled rush of an
unseen pinion, and to pause, breathless, panting, and outdone,
to curse, while you gather breath for a renewed effort,
the bird which haunts such covert, and the covert which
gives shelter to such birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this month, if no untimely frost, or envious snow <a id='flu'></a>flurry
come, premature, to chase him to the sunny swamps of
Carolina and the rice-fields of Georgia, the plump, white-fronted,
pink-legged autumn Woodcock, flaps up from the
alder-brake with his shrill whistle, and soars away, away,
on a swift and powerful wing above the russet tree-tops,
to be arrested only by the instinctive eye and rapid finger
of the genuine sportsman; and no longer as in faint July to
be bullied and bungled to death by every German city pot-hunter,
or every pottering rustic school-boy, equipped and
primed for murder, on his Saturday’s half holyday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this month, the brown-jacketed American hare, which
our folk <span class='it'>will</span> persist in calling <span class='it'>Rabbit</span>—though it neither
lives in warrens, nor burrows habitually under ground,
and though it breeds not every month in the year, which
are the true distinctive characteristics of the Rabbit—is
in his prime of conditions, the leverets of the season,
plump and well grown; and the old bucks and does, recruited
after the breeding season, in high health and
strength, and now legitimate food for gunpowder, legitimate
quarry for the chase of the merry beagles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this month especially, the Quail, the best-loved and
choicest object of the true sportsman’s ambition; the bird
which alone affords more brilliant and exciting sport than
all the rest beside; the bravest on the wing, and the best
on the board; the swiftest and strongest flyer of any
feathered game; the most baffling to find, the most troublesome
to follow up, and when followed up and found, the
most difficult to kill in style; the beautiful American
Quail is in his highest force and feather; and in this
month, according to the laws of all the States, even the
most rigorous and stringent in preservation, killable
legitimately under statute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In New York, generally, the close-time for the Quail
ends with October, and he may not be slain until the first
day of November; in New Jersey, <span class='it'>ortygicide</span> commences
on the 25th of October, in Massachusetts and Connecticut
on some day between the 15th of the past and the
first of the present month; in Pennsylvania, Delaware and
Maryland, where they are something more forward, as
breeding earlier in the season than in the Eastern States,
on the first of October; and in Canada West, where they
are exceedingly abundant, on the first of September;
which is, for many reasons, entirely too early, as hereafter
I shall endeavor to demonstrate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my own opinion, the first of November, and even the
middle of October, are too late for the termination of
the Quail’s close-time, inasmuch as five-sevenths of
the broods in ordinarily forward seasons are full-grown
and strong on the wing, as well as all the crops off the
ground, by the first of October; and although the late,
second, or third broods may be undersized, they are still
well able to take care of themselves in case the parent
birds are killed; whereas, on account of their immature
size, they are safe from the legitimate shot; and, on account
of their unsaleability in market to the restaurant, from
the poaching pot-shot also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should, therefore, myself, be strongly inclined to advocate
the adoption of one common day, and that day the
first of October, for the close-time of all our upland game;
the English Snipe alone excepted. Touching the reasons
for postponing the day of Woodcock-shooting, a notice
will be found in our July number, and an extended discussion
in my Field Sports, vol. I. pp. 169 to 200. Of the
Quail, in regard to this point, I have said enough here,
unless this; that, in my opinion, there is far more need to
protect them from the trap during the wintry snows, than
from the gun in the early autumn; the latter cannot possibly
at any time exterminate the race; the former not
only easily <span class='it'>may</span>, but actually <span class='it'>does</span> all but annihilate the
breed, whenever the snow falls and lies deep during any
weeks of December, during the whole of which month the
pursuit and sale of this charming little bird is legal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could I have my way, the close-time for Quail should
end on the last day of September; and the shooting season
end on the twenty-fourth day of December; before which
date snow now rarely lies continuously in New Jersey,
Southern New York, or Pennsylvania. Why I would
anticipate the termination of the close-time, in reference
to the Ruffed Grouse, I shall state at length, when I come
to treat of that noble bird, in our December issue; to
which month I have attributed it, because it is then that
it <span class='it'>is</span>, though in my opinion, <span class='it'>it ought not to be</span>, most frequently
seen on our tables. While on the topic of preservation,
I will mention a fact, which certainly is not
widely, much less generally known, among farmers;
namely, that this merry and domestic little bird is one of
his best friends and assistants in the cultivation of his
lands. During nine or ten months of the year he subsists
entirely on the seeds of many of the most troublesome and
noxious weeds and grasses, which infest the fields, more
especially those of the ragwort, the dock, and the briar.
It is believed, I might almost say ascertained, that he never
plucks any kind of grain, even his own loved buckwheat
when ripe, from the stalk, but only gleans the fallen seeds
from the stubbles after harvest, so that while he in nothing
deteriorates the harvest to be ingathered, he tends
in the highest degree to the preservation of clean and unweeded
fields and farms; indeed, when it is taken into
consideration that each individual Quail consumes daily
nearly two gills of weed-seed, it will be at once evident
that a few bevies of these little birds, carefully and assiduously
preserved on a farm, will do more toward keeping
it free of weeds, than the daily annual labor of a dozen
farm-servants. This preservation will not be counteracted
or injured by a moderate and judicious use of the
gun in the autumnal months; for the bevies need thinning,
especially of the cock-birds, which invariably outnumber
the hens, and which, if unable to pair, from a want of
mates, form into little squads or companies of males,
which remain barren, and become the deadly enemies of
the young cocks of the following year, beating them off
and dispersing them; though, strange to say, they will
themselves never mate again, nor do aught, after remaining
unpaired during one season, to propagate their species.
The use of the trap, on the contrary, destroying whole
bevies at a swoop, where the gun, even in the most skillful
hands, rarely much more than decimates them, may, in a
single winter’s day, if many traps be set, destroy the whole
stocking of a large farm for years, if not forever. I have
myself invariably remarked, since my attention was first
called to the fact, that those farms which are best stocked
with Quail, are invariably the cleanest of weeds; and a
right good sportsman, and good friend of mine, working
on the same base <span class='it'>per contra</span>, says that, in driving his
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
shooting-cart and dogs through a country, he has never
found it worth his while to stop and beat a district full
of weedy and dirty farms, as such never contain Quail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this may lead our farmers to consider that every live
Quail does far more good on the farm, than the shilling
earned by his capture in the <span class='it'>omnivorous</span> trap; and
therefore to prohibit their sons and farm-boys from exterminating
them at their utmost need, when food is scarce,
and shelter hard to find, my words will not have been
altogether wasted, nor my object unattained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were I a farmer, I would hang it over my kitchen fireplace,
inscribed in goodly capitals—“Spare the Quail! If
you would have clean fields and goodly crops, spare the
Quail! So shall you spare your labor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, in a few words, we will on to their nomenclature,
their distinctive marks, their regions of inhabitation,
seasons, haunts, and habits; and last, not least, how,
when, and where lawfully, honorably, sportsmanly, and
gnostically, you may and shall, kill them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not, however, here pause long to discuss the point,
whether they ought to be termed Quail or Partridge.
Scientifically and practically they are neither, but a connecting
link between the two <span class='it'>subgenera</span>. True Partridge,
nor true Quail, very <span class='it'>perdix</span>, nor very <span class='it'>coturnix</span>, exists at
all anywhere in America. Our bird, an intermediate bird
between the two, named by the naturalists <span class='it'>Ortyx</span>, which
is the Greek term for true Quail, is peculiar to America, of
which but one species, that before us, is found in the
United States, except on the Pacific coast and in California,
where there are many other beautiful varieties.
Our bird is known everywhere East, and everywhere
North-west of Pennsylvania, and in Canada, as the Quail—everywhere
South as the Partridge. In size, plumage,
flight, habits, and cry, it more closely resembles the European
Quail; in some structural points, especially the
shape and solidity of the bill, the European Partridge. On
the whole, I deem it properly termed <span class='sc'>American Quail</span>;
but whether of the two it shall be called, matters little, as
no other bird on this continent can clash with it, so long
as we avoid the ridicule of calling one bird by two different
terms, on the opposite sides of one river—the Delaware.
The stupid blunder of calling the Ruffed Grouse,
Pheasant, and Partridge, in the South and East, is a totally
different kind of misnomer; as that bird bears no resemblance,
however distant, to either of the two species,
and has a very good English name of his own, <span class='it'>videlicet</span>,
“Ruffed or Tippeted Grouse,” by which alone he is known
to men of brains or of sportsmanship. With regard to our
Quail, it is different, as he has no distinctive English name
of his own; but is, even by naturalists, indiscriminately
known as Quail and Partridge. The former is certainly
the truer appellation, as he approximates more closely to
that sub-genus. We wish much that this question could
be settled; which we fear, now, that it never can be, from
the want of any sporting <span class='it'>authority</span>, in the country, to
pass judgment. The “Spirit of the Times,” though still
as well supported and as racy as ever, has, I regret
to say, ceased to be an authority, and has become a mere
arena wherein for every scribbler to discuss and support
his own undigested and crude notions without consideration
or examination; and wherein those who know the
least, invariably fancying themselves to know the most,
vituperate with all the spite of partisan personality, every
person who having learned more by reading, examination
of authorities, and experience than they, ventures to express
an opinion differing from their old-time prejudices,
and the established misnomers of provincial or sectional
vulgarism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to resume, the American Quail, or “Partridge
of the South,” is too well known throughout the whole
of America, from the waters of the Kennebec on the East,
and the Great Lakes on the North—beyond which latter,
except on the South-western peninsula of Canada West,
lying between Lakes Erie, St. Clair, and Huron, they are
scarcely to be found—is too well known, almost to the
extreme South, to need description. Their beauty, their
familiar cry, their domestic habits during the winter, when
they become half civilized, feeding in the barn-yards, and
often roosting under the cattle-sheds with the poultry,
render them familiar to all men, women, boys and fools
throughout the regions, which they inhabit. It is stated
by ornithologists, that they abound from Nova Scotia and
the northern parts of Canada to Florida and the Great
Osage villages; but this is incorrect, as they rarely are
seen eastward of Massachusetts; <span class='it'>never</span> in Nova Scotia, or
Canada East; and range so far as Texas, and the edges of
the great American salt desert. The adult male bird
differs from the hen in having its chaps and a remarkable
gorget on the throat and lower neck, pure white, bordered
with jetty black; which parts, in the young male and the
adult female, are bright reddish-yellow; the upper parts
of both are beautifully dashed and freckled with chestnut
and mahogany-brown, black, yellow, gray, and pure
white; the under parts pure white, longitudinally dashed
with brownish red, and transversely streaked with black
arrow-headed marks. The colors of the male are all
brighter, and more definite, than in the female.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everywhere eastward of the Delaware the Quail is
resident, never rambling far from the haunts in which he
is bred. Everywhere to the westward he is in the later
autumn migratory, moving constantly on foot, and never
flying except when flushed or compelled to cross streams
and water-courses, from the west eastward; the farther
west, the more marked is this peculiarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Quail pairs early in March; begins to lay early in
May, in a nest made on the surface of the ground, usually
at the bottom of a tussock or tuft of grass, her eggs being
pure white, and from ten to thirty-two in number, though
about fourteen is probably the average of the bevies. The
period of incubation is about four weeks, the young birds
run the instant they clip the shell, and fly readily before
they have been hatched a fortnight. So soon as the first
brood is well on the wing, the cock takes charge of it,
and the hen proceeds to lay and hatch a second, the male
bird and first brood remaining in the close vicinity, and
the parents, I doubt not, attending the labor of incubation
and attending the young. This I have long suspected;
but I saw so many proofs of it, in company of my friend
and fellow sportsman, “Dinks,” while shooting together
near Fort Malden, in Canada West—where we found, in
many instances, two distinct bevies of different sizes with
a single pair of old birds, when shooting early in September
of last year—that we were equally convinced of
the truth of the fact, and of the unfitness of the season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In October, with the exception of a very few late broods,
they are fit for the gun; and then, while the stubbles are
long, and the weeds and grasses rank, they lie the best and
are the least wild on the wing. The early mornings and
late afternoons are the fittest times for finding them, when
they are on the run, and feeding in the edges of wheat and
rye stubbles, or buckwheat patches bordering on woodlands.
In the middle of the day they either lie up in little
brakes and bog-meadows, or bask on sandy banks, and
craggy hill-sides, when they are collected into little
huddles, and are then difficult to find. As soon as flushed,
they pitch into the thickest neighboring covert, whether
bog-meadow, briar-patch, cedar-brake, ravine, or rough
corn-stubble, they can find, their flight being wild, rapid,
and impetuous, but rarely very long, or well sustained.
As they unquestionably possess the mysterious power,
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
whether voluntary or involuntary, of holding in their
scent, for a short time after alighting, and are difficultly
found again till they have run, I recommend it, as by
far the better way, to mark them down well, and beat
for another bevy, until you hear them calling to each other;
then lose no time in flushing them again, when they are
sure to disperse, and you to have sport with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myself, I prefer setters for their pursuit, as more dashing,
more enduring, and abler to face briars—others prefer
pointers, as steadier on less work, and better able to fag
without water. Either, well broke, are good—ill broke,
or unbroke, worthless. Still give me setters—Russian or
Irish specially! Quail fly very fast, and strong, especially
in covert, and require the whole charge to kill them dead
and clean. At cross shots, shoot well ahead; at rising
shots, well above; and at straight-away shots, a trifle
below your birds; and an oz. ¼ of No. 8, early, and of
No. 7, late, will fetch them in good style. And so good
sport to you, kind reader; for this, if I err not, is doomed
to be a crack Quail season.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The poet’s rare and wondrous gifts</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Thy heart, with one high throb, can rise</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;His fair, heroic dreams above—</p>
<p class='line'>There breathes more passion in thy voice</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Than in a thousand lays of love.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Ah, know’st thou not, the while thou deem’st</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The poet’s mission most divine,</p>
<p class='line'>Life’s grand, unwritten poetry</p>

<p class='line'>What though it falleth brokenly,</p>

<p class='line'>Though clamorous voices cry it down,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To God it rises, pure and clear!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And rolled their anthems to His feet.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>When, like the Grecian youth, thou see’st</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The midnight tempests gather round—</p>

Poem. By William Wordsworth. New
York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Excursion. By William Wordsworth. New York:
C. S. Francis &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was known as long ago as 1814, that Wordsworth
had written the present poem, and that it would not be
published until after his death. It now appears that it
was commenced as far back as 1799, and was finally completed
in 1805. The purpose of the poem is to exhibit the
gradual growth of the poet’s mind, from its first development
of imagination and passion, to the period when he
conceived he had grown up to that height of contemplation
which would justify his attempt to realize the great
object of his life—the production of a philosophic poem
on Man, Nature, and Society. “The Prelude,” is addressed
to Coleridge, the poet’s intimate friend; and the
egotism of the narrative is much modified, by its being
thus seemingly intended, not for the public, but for the
poet-metaphysician into whose single heart and brain its
revelations are poured. The character of the poem is
essentially psychological, the object being to notice only
those events and scenes which fed and directed the poet’s
mind, and to regard them, not so much in their own nature,
as in their influence on the nature of the poet. The
topics, therefore, though trite in themselves, are all made
original from the peculiarities of the person conceiving
them. His childhood and school-time, his residence at
the university, his summer vacation, his visit to the Alps,
his tour through France, his residence in London and
France, are the principal topics; but the enumeration of
the topics can convey no impression of the thought, observation,
and imagination, the eloquent philosophy, vivid
imagery, and unmistakable <span class='it'>Wordsworthianism</span>, which
characterize the volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be admitted, however, that “The Prelude,”
with all its merits, does not add to the author’s great
fame, however much it may add to our knowledge of his
inner life. As a poem it cannot be placed by the side of
The White Doe, or The Excursion, or the Ode on Childhood,
or the Ode on the Power of Sound; and the reason
is to be found in its strictly didactic and personal character,
necessitating a more constant use of analysis and
reflection, and a greater substitution of the metaphysical
for the poetic process, than poetry is willing to admit.
Though intended as an introduction to “The Excursion,”
it has not its sustained richness of diction and imagery;
and there is little of that easy yielding of the mind to the
inspiration of objects, and that ecstatic utterance of the
emotions they excite, which characterize passages selected
at random from the latter poem—as in that grand rushing
forth of poetic impulse, in the Fourth Book:</p>

<p class='line'>Oh! what a joy it were in vigorous health,</p>
<p class='line'>To have a body (this our vital frame</p>
<p class='line'>With shrinking sensibility endued,</p>
<p class='line'>And all the nice regards of flesh and blood,)</p>
<p class='line'>And to the elements surrender it</p>
<p class='line'>As if it were a spirit! How divine,</p>
<p class='line'>The liberty, for frail, for mortal man</p>
<p class='line'>To roam at large among unpeopled glens</p>
<p class='line'>And mountainous retirements, only trod</p>
<p class='line'>By devious footsteps; regions consecrate</p>
<p class='line'>To oldest time! and, reckless of the storm</p>
<p class='line'>That keeps the raven quiet in her nest,</p>
<p class='line'>Be as a presence or a motion—one</p>
<p class='line'>Among the many there; and while the mists</p>
<p class='line'>Flying, and rainy vapors, call out shapes</p>
<p class='line'>And phantoms from the crags and solid earth</p>
<p class='line'>As fast as a musician scatters sounds</p>
<p class='line'>Out of an instrument; and while the streams</p>
<p class='line'>(As at a first creation, and in haste</p>
<p class='line'>To exercise their untried faculties)</p>
<p class='line'>Descending from the region of the clouds,</p>
<p class='line'>And starting from the hollows of the earth</p>
<p class='line'>More multitudinous every moment, rend</p>
<p class='line'>Their way before them—what a joy to roam</p>
<p class='line'>An equal among mightiest energies;</p>
<p class='line'>And haply sometimes with articulate voice,</p>
<p class='line'>Amid the deafening tumult, scarcely heard</p>
<p class='line'>By him that utters it, exclaim aloud,</p>
<p class='line'>“Be this continued so from day to day,</p>
<p class='line'>Nor let the fierce commotion have an end.</p>
<p class='line'>Ruinous though it be, from month to month.”</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The Prelude” has many fine descriptions of nature,
but nothing which rises to the beauty and sublimity of
the following passage from “The Excursion”:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;—when a step,</p>
<p class='line'>A single step, that freed me from the skirts</p>
<p class='line'>Of the blind vapor, opened to my view</p>
<p class='line'>Glory beyond all glory ever seen</p>
<p class='line'>By waking sense or by the dreaming soul!</p>
<p class='line'>The appearance, instantaneously disclosed</p>
<p class='line'>Was of a mighty city—boldly say</p>
<p class='line'>A wilderness of building, sinking far</p>
<p class='line'>And self-withdrawn into a wondrous depth,</p>
<p class='line'>Far sinking into splendor—without end!</p>
<p class='line'>Fabric it seemed of diamond and gold,</p>
<p class='line'>With alabaster domes, and silver spires,</p>
<p class='line'>And blazing terrace upon terrace, high</p>
<p class='line'>Uplifted; here, serene pavilions bright,</p>
<p class='line'>In avenues disposed; there, towers begirt</p>
<p class='line'>With battlements that on their restless fronts</p>
<p class='line'>Bore stars—illumination of all gems!</p>
<p class='line'>By earthly nature had the effect been wrought</p>
<p class='line'>Upon the dark materials of the storm</p>
<p class='line'>Now pacified; on them, and on the coves</p>
<p class='line'>And mountain-steeps and summits, whereunto</p>
<p class='line'>The vapors had receded, taking there</p>
<p class='line'>Their station under a cerulean sky.</p>
<p class='line'>Oh! ’twas an unimaginable sight!</p>
<p class='line'>Clouds, mists, streams, watery rocks and emerald turf,</p>
<p class='line'>Clouds of all tincture, rocks and sapphire sky,</p>
<p class='line'>Confused, commingled, mutually inflamed,</p>
<p class='line'>Molten together, and composing thus,</p>
<p class='line'>Each lost in each, that marvelous array</p>
<p class='line'>Of temple, palace, citadel, and huge</p>
<p class='line'>Fantastic pomp of structure without name,</p>
<p class='line'>In fleecy folds voluminous, enwrapped.</p>
<p class='line'>Right in the midst, where interspace appeared</p>
<p class='line'>Of open court, an object like a throne</p>
<p class='line'>Under a shining canopy of state</p>
<p class='line'>Stood fixed; and fixed resemblances were seen</p>
<p class='line'>To implements of ordinary use,</p>
<p class='line'>But vast in size, in substance glorified;</p>
<p class='line'>Such as by Hebrew prophets were beheld</p>
<p class='line'>In vision—forms uncouth of mightiest power</p>
<p class='line'>For admiration and mysterious awe.</p>
<p class='line'>Below me was the earth; this little vale</p>
<p class='line'>Lay low beneath my feet; ’twas visible—</p>
<p class='line'>I saw not, but I felt that it was there.</p>
<p class='line'>That which I <span class='it'>saw</span> was the revealed abode</p>
<p class='line'>Of spirits in beatitude.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Not only do we see the superiority of “The Excursion”
in such passages as these, but the didactic thought
is more assured, is more colored by imagination, and melts
more readily into soft, sweet, melodious expression. Take
the following, for instance:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Within the soul a faculty abides,</p>
<p class='line'>That with interpositions, which would hide</p>
<p class='line'>And darken, so can deal, that they become</p>
<p class='line'>Contingencies of pomp; and serve to exalt</p>
<p class='line'>Her native brightness. As the ample moon,</p>
<p class='line'>In the deep stillness of a summer even</p>
<p class='line'>Rising behind a thick and lofty grove,</p>
<p class='line'>Burns, like an unconsuming fire of light,</p>
<p class='line'>In the green trees; and, kindling on all sides</p>
<p class='line'>Their leafy umbrage, turns the dusky veil</p>
<p class='line'>Into a substance glorious as her own,</p>
<p class='line'>Yea, with her own incorporated, by power</p>
<p class='line'>Capacious and serene: like power abides</p>
<p class='line'>In man’s celestial spirit; virtue thus</p>
<p class='line'><span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span></p>
<p class='line'>Sets forth and magnifies herself; thus feeds</p>
<p class='line'>A calm, a beautiful, and silent fire,</p>
<p class='line'>From the encumbrances of mortal life,</p>
<p class='line'>From error, disappointment—nay, from guilt;</p>
<p class='line'>And sometimes, so relenting justice wills;</p>
<p class='line'>From palpable oppressions of despair.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If “The Prelude” has thus fewer “trances of thought
and mountings of the mind” than “The Excursion,” it
still bears the marks of the lofty and thoughtful genius of
the author, and increases our respect for his personal character.
The books devoted to his residence in Cambridge,
his tour to the Alps, and to the influence of the French
Revolution upon his genius and character, are additions
to the philosophy of the human mind. We believe that
few metaphysicians ever scanned their consciousness with
more intensity of vision, than Wordsworth was wont to
direct upon his; and in the present poem he has subtily
noted, and firmly expressed, many new psychological laws
and processes. The whole subject of the development of
the mind’s creative faculties, and the vital laws of mental
growth and production, has been but little touched by
professed metaphysicians; and we believe “The Prelude”
conveys more real available knowledge of the facts and
laws of man’s internal constitution, than can be found in
Hume or Kant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have not space for many extracts from the poem.
Its philosophical value could not be indicated by quotations,
and we shall content ourselves with citing a few
random passages, illustrative of its general style and
thought. The following lines exhibit the tendency of
Wordsworth’s mind, when a youth at college:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>I looked for universal things; perused</p>
<p class='line'>The common countenance of earth and sky:</p>
<p class='line'>Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace</p>
<p class='line'>Of that first Paradise whence man was driven;</p>
<p class='line'>And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed</p>
<p class='line'>By the proud name she bears—the name of Heaven.</p>
<p class='line'>I called on both to teach me what they might;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>Or turning the mind in upon herself,</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>And spread them with a wider creeping; felt</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>Incumbencies more awful</span>, visitings</p>
<p class='line'>Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul</p>
<p class='line'>That tolerates the <span class='it'>indignities</span> of Time,</p>
<p class='line'>And from the centre of Eternity</p>
<p class='line'>All finite motions, overruling, lives</p>
<p class='line'>In glory immutable.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;—</p>
<p class='line'>To every natural form, rock, fruit, or flower,</p>
<p class='line'>Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,</p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>I gave a moral life</span>: I saw them feel,</p>
<p class='line'>Or linked them to some feeling! <span class='it'>the great mass</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>That I beheld respired with inward meaning.</span></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the following stern description, he records his condemnation
of life as he found it at the great English
university of Cambridge:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For, all degrees</p>
<p class='line'>And shapes of spurious fame and short-lived praise</p>
<p class='line'>Here sat in state, and fed with daily alms</p>
<p class='line'>Retainers won away from solid good;</p>
<p class='line'>And here was Labor, his own bond-slave; Hope,</p>
<p class='line'>That never set the pains against the prize;</p>
<p class='line'>Idleness halting with his weary clog,</p>
<p class='line'>And poor misguided Shame, and witless Fear,</p>
<p class='line'>And simple Pleasure foraging for Death;</p>
<p class='line'>Honor misplaced, and Dignity astray;</p>
<p class='line'>Feuds, factions, flatteries, enmity, and guile</p>
<p class='line'>Murmuring submission, and bold government,</p>
<p class='line'>(The idol weak as the idolater)</p>
<p class='line'>And Decency and Custom starving Truth,</p>
<p class='line'>And blind Authority beating with his staff</p>
<p class='line'>The child that might have led him; Emptiness</p>
<p class='line'>Followed as of good omen, and meek Worth</p>
<p class='line'>Left to herself unheard of and unknown.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The most remarkable line in the poem, a line almost
equal to Milton’s “Thoughts that wander through eternity,”
is that which concludes the following passage on
the statue of Newton at Cambridge:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>And from my pillow, looking forth by light</p>
<p class='line'>Of moon or favoring stars, I could behold</p>
<p class='line'>The antechapel where the statue stood</p>
<p class='line'>Of Newton with his prism and silent face,</p>
<p class='line'>The marble index of a mind forever</p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With the lingering, mysterious music of this line
sounding in our ears, it would be an impertinence to continue
these loose remarks on “The Prelude” any further;
and we close by commending the poem to the thoughtful
attention of thinking readers.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Christian Thought on Life: In a Series of Discourses.
By Henry Giles, Author of Lectures and Essays. Boston:
Ticknor, Reed &amp; Fields. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this beautiful volume is a born orator,
whose written style instinctively takes the form of eloquence,
and whose strong and deep emotions are at once
the inspirers and guides of his pen. He has given us
here a dozen discourses, full of living thoughts and winged
words, and with not a page which is open to the charge
of dullness or triteness. When his theme compels him to
introduce common thoughts he avoids commonplaces, and
we cannot recognize the old acquaintance of our brain in
the fresh and sparkling expression in which it here appears.
Mr. Giles, indeed, is so thoroughly a thinker, and
his mind is so pervaded by his sentiments, that where he
lacks novelty he never lacks originality, and always gives
indications of having conceived every thought he expresses.
Nobody can read the present volume without
being kindled by the vivid vitality with which it presents
old truths, and the superb boldness with which it announces
new ones. Among the many eloquent and impassioned
discourses in the volume, that entitled “The
Guilt of Contempt” is perhaps the sharpest in mental
analysis, and closest and most condensed in style. It will
rank with the best sermons ever delivered from an American
pulpit. Another excellent and striking discourse is
on the subject of spiritual incongruities as illustrated in
the life of David. The five discourses on the Worth, the
Personality, the Continuity, the Struggle, the Discipline,
of Life, are remarkable for their clear statement of Christian
principles, and the knowledge they evince of the inward
workings of thought and emotions. Prayer and
Passion is a sermon which securely threads all the labyrinths
of selfishness, and exposes its most cunning movements
and disguises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will give a few sentences illustrative of Mr. Giles’
mode of treating religious subjects, and the peculiar union
of thought and emotion in his common style of expression.
Speaking of the Psalms of David, he says—“They alone
contain a poetry that meets the spiritual nature in all its
moods and in all its wants, which strengthens virtue with
glorious exhortations, gives angelic eloquence to prayer,
and almost rises to the seraph’s joy in praise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For
assemblies or for solitude, for all that gladdens and all
that grieves, for our heaviness and despair, for our remorse
and our redemption, we find in these divine harmonies
the loud or the low expression. Great has been their
power in the world. They resounded amidst the courts
of the tabernacle; they floated through the lofty and
solemn spaces of the temple. They were sung with glory
in the halls of Zion; they were sung with sorrow by the
streams of Babel. And when Israel had passed away,
the harp of David was still awakened in the church of
Christ. In all the eras and ages of that church, from the
hymn which first it whispered in an upper chamber, until
its anthems filled the earth, the inspiration of the royal
prophet has enraptured its devotions and ennobled its
ritual. And thus it has been, not alone in the august
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
cathedral or the rustic chapel. Chorused by the winds of
heaven, they have swelled through God’s own temple of
the sky and stars; they have rolled over the broad desert
of Asia, in the matins and vespers of ten thousand hermits.
They have rung through the deep valleys of the Alps, in
the sobbing voices of the forlorn Waldenses; through the
steeps and caves of Scottish highlands, in the rude chantings
of the Scottish Covenanters; through the woods and
wilds of primitive America, in the heroic hallelujahs of
the early pilgrims.”</p>

Anecdotes, and Reminiscences. By Joseph T.
Buckingham. Boston: Little &amp; Brown. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of these volumes has been long extensively
known as one of the leading editors of the country; and
his age and experience peculiarly qualify him to do justice
to the subject he here undertakes to treat. His own recollections
must extend back some sixty years; and
during that period he has been constantly connected with
newspapers, either as printer’s apprentice, journeyman,
or editor. He knew intimately most of the editors and
writers for the press, who took prominent parts in the
political controversies at the formation of the government,
and during the first twenty years of its administration,
and he is thoroughly acquainted with all the New England
newspapers which appeared before the Revolution
and during its progress. The work, therefore, is a reflection
of the spirit of old times, giving their very “form
and pressure,” and exhibiting, sometimes in a ludicrous
light, old political passions in all their original frenzy of
thought and form of expression. The specimens given of
newspaper literature, in verse and prose, are all interesting
either for their folly or wisdom, and some of them
are valuable as curiosities of rhetoric and logic. Not only
is the work valuable to the antiquary, the historian, and
the members of “the craft,” but it contains matter sufficiently
piquant to stimulate and preserve the attention of
the general reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of these volumes is a marked instance of
that inherent strength of character which pursues knowledge
under difficulties, and is victorious over all obstacles
which obstruct the elevation of the friendless.
Without having received even a school education, and
passing the period that boys usually devote to Lindley
Murray in a printing office, he is one of the most vigorous
and polished writers in New England, and in thorough
acquaintance with classical English literature has no
superiors. Every thing he writes bears the signs, not
merely of intellect and taste, but of forcible character;
and we believe that a selection from his newspaper articles
would make a volume, which for originality of
thought, and raciness of expression, would be an addition
to our literature.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Songs of Labor, and Other Poems. By John G. Whittier.
Boston: Ticknor, Reed &amp; Fields. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Whittier’s popularity, great as it is, must be increased
by these Songs of Labor. In them, the Ship-Builders,
Shoemakers, Drovers, Fishermen, Huskers and Lumbermen,
are gifted with vigorous and melodious utterance,
in songs whose chime is the very echo of their occupations.
The other poems of the collection are of a merit
as various as their themes. The best is the poem entitled
“Memories,” one of the most exquisitely tender, thoughtful
and imaginative poems in our literature. “Pious IX.”
and “Elliott,” are essentially battle-pieces, and the
rhymes clash together like the crossing of swords. Fierce
and hot as the invective of these poems is, we still think
the business of wrath is much better done in “Ichabod,”
in which rage and scorn take the form of a dirge, and
smiting sarcasms are insinuated through the phrases of
grief. Throughout the volume we are impressed with
the great nature of the author, and the superiority of the
man to any thing he has yet produced. He unites, in a
singular degree, tenderness with strength, delicate fancy
with blazing imagination, sensitive sentiment with sturdy
character; and his most exhilarating and trumpet-voiced
lyrics have the air of impromptus. In the following
lines, for instance, from a poem in the present volume on
“The Peace Convention at Brussels,” he extemporises
as good heroic verse as Campbell’s:</p>

1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To judge from the dedication, the authoress of this
goodly duodecimo must be the daughter of Cooper, the
novelist. She has much of her father’s remarkable descriptive
power, but is happily deficient in that fretful
discontent which disturbs the harmony of his later productions.
The volume will be found a delightful companion
both to the denizen of the city and country. The
writer wins upon the reader’s sympathies with every
page. Her intelligence is clear and quiet, enlarged by
intimacy with nature and good books, and elevated by a
beautiful and unobtrusive piety. We hope this will not
be her last production.</p>

and Memory. By Blanchard Fosgate, M. D.
New York: George P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This thin volume is devoted to a subject which, though
its discussion involves a consideration of topics properly
metaphysical, has more general interest than any other in
the science of metaphysics, because its phenomena stimulate
the curiosity of all who, like Richard the Third, are
troubled with dreams. The author supports, with great
power of illustration and argument, three propositions,
viz., that during sleep the mental faculties are as active
as during wakefulness; that memory is no criterion by
which to judge the mind in sleep; and that the mind is
dependent upon the integrity of the organs of external sensation
for a remembrance of what transpires during this
state. The discussion of these topics is enlivened by
many curious examples.</p>

LL. D. New York: George P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a thick volume of some seven hundred pages,
completely crammed with facts relating to the history,
geography, and present condition of every state in Europe.
The index, containing ten thousand names, will convey
an idea of the amount of matter which the author has compressed
into his volume. Though a work of vast labor,
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
we presume that its value, as a work for constant reference,
will amply repay the expense of compiling it.
Every man who reads European news should possess
the book, provided he desires to read news intelligently.
It gives accurate ideas of the relative importance of the
various States, by exhibiting their financial condition as
well as their territory, population, and productions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every lover of the romantic and picturesque in history
will heartily welcome this re-issue of Irving’s charming
Chronicle. By assuming the position of a contemporary,
he is enabled to exhibit the prejudices of the time with
almost dramatic vividness, and to give events some of the
coloring they derived from Spanish bigotry without obscuring
their real nature and import. The beautiful mischievousness
of the occasional irony which peeps through
the narrative, is in the author’s happiest style. The book
might easily be expanded into a dozen novels, so rich is
it in materials of description and adventure. In its present
form it is replete with accurate history, represented
with pictorial vividness.</p>

Ellet, Author of the Women of the American Revolution.
New York: Baker &amp; Scribner. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The theme which Mrs. Ellet has chosen is an important
one, and absolutely necessary to be comprehended by all
who wish to understand the American Revolution as a
living fact. The great defect of most of our national histories
and biographies is their abstract character, neither
characters nor events being represented in the concrete,
and brought directly home to the hearts and imaginations
of readers. The result is, that most of us, when we
attempt to be patriotic, slide so readily into bombast; for
having no distinct conceptions of what was really done
and suffered by our forefathers and <span class='it'>foremothers</span>, we can
only glorify them by a resort to the dictionary. Mrs.
Ellet’s book is devoted to those scenes and persons in our
revolutionary history, in exhibiting which the novelist is
commonly so far in advance of the historian; and she has
performed her task with much discrimination in the selection
of materials, and no little pictorial power in representing
what she has selected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is Grace Aguilar’s last work, in the most melancholy
sense of the word, she having died of consumption
shortly after its completion. The story is one of much
interest; the sentiments beautiful and pure; the style
sweet and pleasing. We have read none of her novels
with more satisfaction than this. At a period when romance
writing has been so much perverted from its true
purpose, it is delightful to find a novelist who, to a talent

<p class='pindent'>This novel, in title the same as one by Theodore S.

novel of the period of the religious wars in Scotland, and
though not peculiarly excellent in characters, is filled
with stirring events and attractive scenes. The publishers,

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This thick and handsome duodecimo contains many of
the most charming and sprightly of Mr. Willis’s popular
compositions, evincing that singular combination of sentiment
and shrewdness, of poetic feeling and knowledge
of the world, in which he has no American rival. The
style, airy, graceful and fluent, is distinguished by a
“polished want of polish,” a fertility of apt and fanciful

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This novel has hardly the fresh, dashing, daring character
of Dr. Mayo’s first romance, but it still has sufficient
raciness and audacity to serve for a score of common
novels. The author has great tact in so choosing his
scenes and characters that the peculiar powers of his
mind can have free play. In “The Berber” the incidents
follow each other in such quick succession that we make
no demands for originality or power of characterization.
In respect to the latter, Dr. Mayo is so far deficient,

those which form the staple of jest-books. The principal
source whence the editor has derived his brilliancies, is
that most gentlemanly of wits and humorists, Sydney

<p class='pindent'>This novel has been absurdly puffed in England, but it is
nevertheless an interesting and well written one, worthy
the pen which wrote “The Crescent and the Cross.” The
period in which its events and characters are laid, the
Great Rebellion, so called, has not recently been treated,

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Memoirs of the Life of Anne Boleyn, Queen of Henry VIII.
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
By Miss Benger. From the Third London Edition.
With a Memoir of the Author, by Miss Aiken. 1 vol.
Philadelphia: A. Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In some respects we prefer this memoir to that by Miss
Strickland. The only fault we have to find with Miss
Benger, indeed, is that she is too eulogistic. No one, in
this age, doubts that Anne Boleyn was an innocent woman,
who fell a victim partly to political intrigue, partly to her
husband’s fickleness; but it is useless to deny that she
had ambition, and ridiculous to claim for her the character
of a saint. She was, in a word, a witty, graceful, well-read,
fascinating female, vain of applause, a little free in
her manners, a fast friend, and a bitter enemy. She never
loved the king, as she might have loved Percy, had not
Wolsey crossed her path, and converted her into a haughty,
scheming, ambitious woman; but she never, on the other
hand, violated her vows toward Henry, or failed in the
discharge of any wifely duty. Her conduct during the
two years that the divorce was in progress is the most
censurable part of her life. We cannot forgive her for
wringing the heart of the unoffending Catharine. Nor for
her favor toward Henry at this time can we esteem her
as we would have wished. But from the period that she
became the lawful wife of the king her character visibly
improves. She was affable to the low, courteous to the
high, charitable to the needy, just to all. As her sorrows
increase her character rises in loveliness; her frivolity is
cast aside, the haughtiness departs, and the true nobleness
of her heart shines forth. Nothing in history is
more pathetic than the story of her arrest, trial, and execution.
In a court where she had scarcely a friend, she
bore herself with the fortitude of a martyr, asserting her
innocence with an earnestness that carried conviction
even to those who condemned her; and on the scaffold,
though her over-wrought nerves occasionally found vent
in hysterical gayety, her lofty and heroic soul triumphed
over the terrible spectacle of the axe, the block, the
gaping crowd. Her closing career, indeed, has all the
grandeur of a tragedy. We read of it with eyes dim
with tears, and with a heart execrating her murderers.</p>

with a portrait, copied from the celebrated picture of
Holbein.</p>

costly paper, and illustrated with so many engravings
that hundreds of persons, who desired to purchase it, were
withheld by the necessarily high price. To meet the wishes
of this class, the present cheap edition has been issued.
There has been no material change in the letter-press;
the few alterations that have been made are for the
better; but the engravings are omitted; the volume is
printed on poorer paper, and the page is not quite so large.
On the whole we think this edition more desirable than
the first. So much valuable information is embraced in
the narrative of Lieutenant Lynch, that persons curious
respecting the Holy Land, and especially respecting the
Dead Sea, will find themselves amply repaid by a perusal,
and even a re-perusal of this work. Numerous popular
fables respecting the Jordan, the Sea of Galilee, and the
dread Lake of Gomorrah are exploded in this volume; and
a mass of instructive evidence imparted respecting the
geographical character of Palestine, its former fertility,
and the general habits of its inhabitants. It is impossible

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Life and Correspondence of Andrew Combe. M. D. By
George Combe. 1 vol. Philadelphia: A. Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Andrew Combe was almost as universally celebrated
for his works on physiology as his brother, George, is for
his writings in connection with phrenology. The present
biography is a tribute, by the elder brother, to the usefulness
of the younger. As the story of a life, made beneficial
to the human race through a compassionate and
wise heart, and this amid constant ill-health, it is one
of the most valuable offerings of the century to biographical
literature. Apart from this, however, it has a merit in
the narrative of Dr. Combe’s protracted illness, and the
means used successfully by him to prolong life. An early
victim to consumption, he arrested the progress of disease,
and protracted his existence for more than twenty years,
during which period all of his best works were written.
The volume teaches two important lessons: the first, that
in the study of physiology, alleviation may be found for
much of human suffering; the second, that, even in sickness
and sorrow, it is possible, instead of remaining
entirely a burden to others, to be a benefactor of our race.
We have read this work with deep interest, and believe
it will afford equal satisfaction to others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this volume is known, in England, as a
poet of some merit. In the present work he has attempted
a new <span class='it'>role</span>, and has succeeded in it, we are free to confess,
in the very best manner. Mr. De Vere is at once a
scholar and a gentleman. The former qualification renders
him a peculiarly fitting traveler on the classic soil of
Greece; the latter enables him to depict what he has seen
in a manner not offensive to good taste. We have had
so many cockney books on Greece, we have seen
flunkeyism so rampant even in Constantinople, that it is
refreshing to find a work like the present, in which the
knowledge of the man of the world, the stores of the
student, and the enthusiasm of the poet are all combined.
The volume first arrested our attention by its elegant appearance,
and, having once begun it, we could not lay it
aside till we had finished it. There is much in the book,
it is true, which a well-read man will recognize as old;
but then the style makes even this have an air of freshness.

deal that is new.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My dear Parson</span>,—I knew you would be gratified
with my friendly notice of you in the March number of
“Graham”—and your pleasant start of surprise, to express
your ignorance of the writer, was well conceived—you
wicked wag. People who do not know your ways
might almost think you were honest for once in your life,—but
I, who have seen you in your happy moods, understand
what an exquisite point to your wit a falsehood imparts,
and what a choice bit of clerical drollery you consider
it, to offer to <span class='it'>swear</span> to an untruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have adjusted, now, your long score with poor
Poe, to <span class='it'>your own</span> satisfaction, I hope; for ignorant people
will say, that this settlement of accounts after the death
of your friend may be honest—and—<span class='it'>may not be</span>. You see
it lays you open to suspicion, and may soil the surplice
you wear. Your clerical mantle, like Charity, may cover
a multitude of sins, but you should not wear it <span class='it'>too</span> unguardedly.
Charity for the errors of the dead, you know,
is allowable in funeral sermons, even over the cold remains
of those the world scorned and spurned as its
veriest reprobates. Even <span class='it'>you</span> will not class your friend—who
you say was reconciled to you before he died—with
outcasts who forfeit even the last offices of humanity.
You would give even him a Christian burial. “Dust to
dust—ashes to ashes,” methinks, should bury all animosities.
You would not pursue your victim beyond the
grave, and in the same hour pray, “Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.”
This would be horrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it will not do, my dear parson, to attempt to carry
off this departure from Christian practice, with an affectation
of great equity, in the performance of duty.
“Give the devil his due” may be a very orthodox maxim,
but you seem, in adopting it, to have started with the
hypothesis that you had a devil to deal with; yet in the
exercise of justice thus liberally, it would seem but fair to
meet even this Personage face to face, that he might dispute
the account if he felt aggrieved at your estimate. This
last point, I think, you have a fair chance of attaining.
Nor will it do to affect courage and great devotion to
truth. It is very well to say, that vice should be held
up that its deformity may be seen, so as to startle and
deter others. You should be sure that the vice of your
brother is not his misfortune, and that the sin which taints
your own fingers, may not turn crimson in contrast before
the eyes of the gazers. Courage, my dear parson, is
a relative term. You may think it great courage, and a
duty you owe to truth, to assail your friend for wishing
to evade a matrimonial engagement, yet it would be the
veriest weakness and wickedness—if you had set the
worse example of evading your marital duties after the
solemnization. He who sacrifices at the altar should
have clean hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jewels which sometimes ornament the remains of
beauty or worth have tempted, before now, gentlemen of
hardy nerve, but I do not remember that these have ever
taken rank in the annals of knight-errantry. And, my dear
parson—I am talking somewhat freely with you, but you
must pardon me—the feat that you have performed with
so much unction, the despoiling of the fame of a man who
intrusted it to you as a jewel of inestimable value to
him, has not received the applause of a single man of
honor. Your <span class='it'>claqueurs</span> themselves, feel that your performance
is damned. I have no doubt that some faint
glimpses of the truth have reached even your mind. I
would have you pray over this subject, my dear sir, for
your feet stand upon slippery places. In all sincerity, I
would have you revise your creed and reform your practice;
for you do not seem to get even the poor applause
of the world, for wrong-doing.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
